An approximate black figure is rushing between two kiosks beyond the parallel railings of thick posts with two exbraces per bay enjambing beyond a silver coupe a magic duskyellow panel van salt and sand and mud on its apron in drivingly velocitous distribution is passing and railing pickets are flying over the windscreen and into traintracks in snowstripes and another railing in the shade is cracking unobtrusively the lower portion of the windscreen with a calligraphic sympathetic magic animal stroke, the monstrous hybridity of buffering is claiming the sunlight on a utility pole in the snow up through a great buildingshadow at fortyfive degrees across the crossstreet, a semblance of utility lines saggingly across the sky is flickering in slashers of diagonal braid disappearances and reappearances, crossing a lane of traffic a lane of traffic crossing a lane of traffic, a simple fortyfive degree bevel cornice wrapping around the flat roof on impact with the kiosk the windscreen tempering fragmentation or the evenspray of melted snows glimmeringly thousands of sunlight atomisations, the blue of advertisements on a kiosk in the distance is saturating, in the sunlight gold asphalt of crossstreet traffic perpendicular to long lane division stripe space the aspiration of foreshortening seen from the side stripe space lane stripe space lane then the crosscutting shadow, snowclusters fraught with loose macrame of grass a silver hatchback is passing behind a utility pole and across the penumbra of its shadow, roving and tall against the skyhalf and the long urinefur tinge neighboring facade slab with thin pianokey of white of cerulean of soft babyblue sky uncontrollable codeine meandering of low relief pilasters of fenestration up the taupe building shadowcast across the street and up from the sidewalk behind some kiosks the facade windows rhythmically dark in daylight lightlessness or slidesashes glaringly foil pooling toward another of the exact same distant building in rotational translation of ninety degrees in the blue and drybrush cirrus duskward horizon is scratching with the nominal intimation of winter trees, in the sunlight a ghost image statically overriding the drunken panorama, a woman in black with a black hat is standing in front of a small kiosk with simple gable roof spurs and pickets of the railings are sliding up over the windscreen through perpendicular lanes of absent traffic toward a kiosk under the adherence of plastic advertisements for liquid in dark bottles against a vibrant blue background, a black figure is ducking behind a kiosk with a thick zincoxidation fascia circumscription of its flat roof and an adjacent portable toilet shelter
