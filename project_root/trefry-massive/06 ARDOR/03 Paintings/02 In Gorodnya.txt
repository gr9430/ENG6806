the light is not dirty, it is addressing the satin finger and palm caressence sheenhone of wood around the embrasure decayingly, the specularity of the embrasure is receiving both the light and the partial image of the bold muntins from the adjacent sixlight window--two columns of three--creating a false third column with softening of the exterior foliage into a vertical surface of rippling and lactic emerald water, prominent reparations to the glass in running beads of leadsolder silhouette a capital H on the upper left pane and a series of three circular arcs in other panes originating from corners and concluding on the vertical edges except one using the corner as a centerpoint and concluding on the top and side of its pane, leadsolder reparations are delicate to the point that no projections are slicking in the luminous reflection on the embrasure, the same aqueous light on the side wall is revealing the seams and grain of broad clapboards though in its projection through the room is providing no ambient luminance--only black chiaroscuro--the waning crescent of an earhat, a pile of books is glowing on the windowsill with an active composition of loose papers in thin edgewise curves of falling, the wan and verdant light on barren floorboards the glimmering copper fireflies of spurs on black disappearing cavalry jackboots visible only in six aggressives stance occlusions to the luminous floor and in fuzzy terminators of sheen on jackboot vamps and shafts and kneeguards up to kneeguards and emergence of jaundice white ridingbreeches and the glintingly curvaceousness of what may be scabards, a man is sitting on a bench deep in thought over an outspread map on an austere table with his fingertips upon his temples and upturning his cuffs the exposure of all layers of his coldweather livery, the thin map--servile soft and pliant--is hanging over the edge of the table, the pensive man is quite alone amidst maps and charts in various uncoilings on the floor and table and leaning against the far wall, the subtle projection of the vertical muntins is smudging the clapboards behind his hunchback, two chicken feathers are catching the light standing out in a small metal cup on the table and curving edgewise up toward the stack of books on the windowsill, the undersides of his heavy coatsleeves--the thick layers of idleness--are inheriting the stillness of sifting light on the broad articulation of the map down to his elbows on the table, fingers slipping into the band of his earhat, the dripping molten copper downsweep of his scabard on the floor amidst the windfall of papers, haltingly in the mruk are attending the inarticulate ear canals and muttonchops of four identical men with dim orange featureless faces in withdrawal against an indivisible plaster wall, swarming gold glimmeringly in prominence over the apparent tailoring of their dark dolmans in goldmail epaulets with fringes and lanyards aiglets plackets and high collars against the dull dim of the hovel interior, before another window--the gleam of oil in his hair below a bisection of its top right pane with leadsolder from corner to corner--a man in a more ornate dolman with gold frog fastenings is sitting arms akimbo abreast of the far corner of the table where his plumage hat is sitting and white gloves are hanging over the edge of the table, the embrasure in a more direct view is luminous on both sides although the images of the lights in the sheen are more diminutive in foreshortening, a glare on his temple and cheekbone around the divot of his eye is tapering into the jowl of his Souvarov, is glaring at the mapreader over the top of the resting plumage hat,
