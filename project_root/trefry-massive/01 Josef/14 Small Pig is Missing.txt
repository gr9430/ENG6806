a rightly regular 3prism under the exterior stairway bearing on one of its rectangular joining facets, smallpig is resting in the hut with his soft chin on the sill of the entrance where kneeling to him looking very closely a gently caressing zephyr is wavering the fine downy hair on his forehead, Nadia is descriptively specifying the geometries of the hut for her hog & the smallpig as the horizontal extrusion of an equilateral triangle with edges measuring 1.241m & an extrusion depth of 1m with an entrance on one facade that is also an equilateral triangle (edges measuring 54.5cm) although offcenter by 21.2cm (with a sill height of 7.8cm) creating a larger protective interior although the smallpig (during a rare occassion of restfulness (through sagging eyelids (luscious pale eyelashes) he is spotting a bird alighting on a dandelion globe across the yard and (lifting his chin from the sill of the aperture) tearing out of the triangular aperture on a trajectory toward the bird who is hopping down into the crusty dirt and hopping as the smallpig is adjusting his trajectory at highspeed his trotters scurrying into a gallop on a turning radius wide enough that his body is banking slightly into the turning until the bird is lifting off of the dirt where smallpig is skiddingly rolling tumblingly over tummy & hindquarters in dustclouds & hopping up to his trotters scanning quizzically for the bird who is deviously chirping from the top of the arbor beside the tiny fishpond)) being highly sociable is resting his chin on the sill snugglingly into the vertex of the opening, the measurements of the actual construction are as faithful as possible to the vision Nadia is describing however the materials I am scavenging are all smaller (both for framing & cladding) than necessary for continuously spanning any particular element resulting in cobbling together elements is disrupting the expectation of millimeter tolerances and disrupting the protective proportioning Nadia is conceiving for sheltering the two piggies, -- It is Our Belief That You are The Best Piggy In The World -- , runty smallpig is frolicking with an energy & joiedevivre entirely incongruous with the scene through the hazy basement window looking out onto the patchy lawn (the abortive flagstone patio is paradoxically the area where grass is growing most aggressively (the most intense greenery is a jasmine vining tumescently overgrowing the guardrail up to the flimsy porch outside the kitchen upstairs)), he is radiant, snuffling around in the undergrowth at the edge of the pineforest for morsels which upon discovering a particularly toothsome tidbit is supping at the air grinningly snout aloft and gruntingingly munching (his snout active in a series of gesticulations entirely independent from the chewing & swalling of the treatskie), the windfall carpeting of pineneedles across the floor of the copse is continuous & uniform brown interlacingly fluffy indexing of the rovings of smallpig who is snuffling about with his snout & trotters searching for morsels (snails, voles, mice, infant rabbits, beetles, earthworms, larvae, carrion, dung, birdeggs, the seedling

easing his small body easing down into selfleveling muckiness to a depth where (in the manner of an alligator) only his snout & (eyelids closing in ecstacy) eyeballs are above the mudsurface, the constant maintenance (on the crumbling siding & on the cracking concrete foundationwall & on the septic leachfield (filling in depressions in the soft landscape where dirt is eroding down to the piping & gravel creating mudpuddles from the effluent) & on the caulking around window openings & on the collection of pineneedles windfalling out from the edge of the pineforest into the yard)

Spotless But This Yard is Unsightly, I'm Sucking This Mudpuddle Out Of Here Immediately -- with the slurping revving aggravating the silent & shady pineforest where the smallpig is snuffling, from his vantage atop the patio outside the kitchen sliding glass door Payrite is spying the burbling effluent in the depression of dirt in the yard where the smallpig is easing his body down as the mud is rising around him, Payrite is ingressing from the patio and reappearing from around the front of Payriteskip with the wetdry vac (the appearance of which is causing smallpig is fleeing to the perimeter of the forest) & extension cord that he is setting down next to the mudpuddle and on this iteration is returning with (on several returntrips) several buckets of gravel which upon vacuuming the mud from the depression he is dumping as backfill into the depression which although effluent is reentering the volume is not successfully creating the mud much to the disappointment of smallpig who with visible angst is running off into the forest leaving divots in the pinestraw from his trotters (left foreleg touching down and right foreleg & backleg touching down and left backleg touching down and both forelegs lifting and left foreleg touching down and right backleg lifting and right foreleg touching down and left backleg lifting off), -- It is Wonderful That Now Everything is Neat

impervious autoparks, a stormwater creek is flaccidly languidly trickling through the pinestraw at the threshold of proximity between the despondency of Hinckley Estates and the more robust ADA development on the opposite edge of the forest, in these parallax depths of pinetrunk occlusion is the illusion of the primeval (amongst trees with caliper measurements of less than 14cm) where the creek is collecting into a placid swampy grotto and languishing there never brimming or overflowing only evaporating or percolating, the nameless swampiness is welcoming the truant smallpig is

peanuts & cantaloupe & potatoes) that are the preferences of smallpig and placing them at the edge of the forest, a junkpile deep in the forest is containing the castoffs of an unrecognizable civilization is producing durable goods (castglass containers, televisions, castiron kitchensinks, steel soupcans, autos (with hardwood dashboards & castglass headlights), hardwood furniture with natural fabric upholstery (enduringly soft stuffing)) are standing amidst the tree trunks in an orderly arrangement appearing as storage more than dumping for a resurgence of the particular society they are characterizing, the smallpig is snuffling amongst this orderly flotsam searching for food or more good soft mud and finding none is traveling deeper through the forest, motherpig is

armature) that is preserving the normal (as in rightangle (not to the terrain but to earth normal because concrete is selfleveling)) plunging inclination, rendering the smallpig unconscious (not death) through asphyxiation with carbon dioxide and with an assemblage of stiff metal rods leaning at various orientations inside the mould (though not piercing the clay mould in such a way as is creating complications with smoothly removing the casting from the mould) he is propping the unconscious piglet in the mould with only his snout daylighting from the inscription of the pourlevel
