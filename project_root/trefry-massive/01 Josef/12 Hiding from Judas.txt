I am yieldingly walking with cession of my internal guidance to an external forcefulness of an ashlar of black seawater, a hissingly running toilet, I am ambling on weightless pilgrimages through the alleys of Florence in reverie my muscles are rhythmically tensing in isometric response to the cognitive terrain of cobblestones & cloacae, I've awareness of my body prone on the basement concrete floor just beside our snippet of crusty carpet, discomfort is beneficial, walking is not benign, the gait as an act of devotion and penance, walking as a rite is in the family of trauma and although in walking--I'm not considering it discomfort--my body is undergoing very minor traumas, the tenderness in the soles of my feet, beating the aching plantar fleshiness with rubber tubing, stressposing, my calves buring in prevention of my death by hanging, my heart is racing, theatrical execution with a revolver, walking up a long steep incline, cognitive walking through imprisonment in this dwelling in this basement, breathing too deeply is requiring stealth, reproducing the trauma of devotinal walking is much more effective in isometric stressposing that is straining the muscles are releasing agonists into somatic photons sheathingly cylindrical hue groupings of lavender & violet scrim for receiving the projection of my walking vista, walking is facilitating my analysis of the Ktiya data, I'm not desirous of visualizing myself walking toward the brilliant red facade of the Kashalot, for productivity of walking the goal is being elsewhere from the site of scrutiny, the notion of background processing is possibly the only beneficial aspect of the administrative faith, one cannot solve a problem through direct physical action, that ilk of forcefulness is resulting only in missteps, active forcefulness is antithetical to essential solutions or outcomes, floating downstream, trees uprootingly ensnaring on the riverbanks are belonging there, hauling a tree downriver on an autobarge and depositing it in the sea is not essential to its truthful mechanisms, airbubbles in an eddy upstream are bursting where the passivity of riverrun dynamics are promoting--are they failures--is that annihilation the most proper transformation of those particular airbubbles, doing too much in the creation of what is seemingly the palette of ideal circumstances is inelegant & disingenuous, there is perhaps joy in dying under the open sky--not the picturesque death of a man crumpling forward in the midst of poetry recitation--there is joy in dying naturally and not by force but the essential transpiration of life flowing out, it is odd that the ADA embracing background processing is also so adoring of execution, although perhaps the variety of death I am living now--the translucent death of exilation--is the true ADA annihilation of erasure or erosion, stripping the protective rind of identity and locality in the creation of a scenario in which the self is slowly sloughing into the alien regolith, the action of removing me from my home was forceful what knowledge am I possessing that it was not inevitable--I've no option but passivity--, these interrogatories are what the administrative faith is baking into even the most agnostic as a cultural norm, the acceptance of a world in which every event is inescapably providential even as the Daemon is making selective efforts and taking strategic actions insuring those events, the actual physically verifiable presence of Payrite is distant, is at the end of a corridor & visible from the woods in the glass doors of the kitchen & atop the stairs, is in motion--even negligibly with the listless drifting of a leaf on a glassy pond--toward, not away from, in pursuit creepingly absently encountering Nadia or myself and snapping to attention with a wry entreaty or criticism, walking in the yard and hiding in bushes, I am establishing continuous circuits for strolling through the dwelling & garden--<<Payriteskip>>--for not stopping, walking is keeping my blood in preoccupation with my musculature rather than my brain, walking is differing from pacing that is requiring fullstops rather than gently banking arcs, more aptly meandering is the developmental mechanism of mysterious cognitive constructions, nothing superficially comprehensible is valuable, no argument with a legible logical framework is true--or achiral--, the slenderly weak pinetrees in the copse behind <<Payriteskip>> are benchmarking angular measurements of my geographic relationship with the dwelling where Payrite is in the kitchen window [T] & behind the sliding glass doors [T△3] & dimly into the hallway [T△7] & a limpingly puffpuff rustling of bedroom window treatments [T△14], the geography of the dwelling is only useful to me in relative to the geography of the garden, Payrite at dusk, Payrite in gauze halflight--his wandering outside is dependent on environmental variables causing lamplight luminosity of the interior brighter than exterior--dissembling into tall dead grass and treetrunks is feigning meditation--apparent from his furtively punctuating glancing back at the dwelling to each window is monitoring for movement inside--with lips moving in his performance of cogitation, Payrite is in the garden behind the trees & Judas is in the hallway is pouncing on the opportunity of confronting Nadia in the hallway--I am listening from below the stairs--with an exegesis on Methodists and their failures both intellectually and in economic selfsacrifice to the ADA, Payrite in passing is shielding his eyes from the luminous cloudiness is surveiling me through the basement window, his quickness is mathematical and only evadable with equal calculative cunning, understanding the geography--speleography--of <<Payriteskip>> is only the most rudimentary strategic foundation for evading Payrite upon which is necessarily an innate and fasttwitching responsiveness to concepts involving the Clothesshy-Wilshire equations & stochastic decision theory & graphsearching & radiodromic pursuitcurve geometry, activation of the chasescene with a sufficient distance [△V·>T△3] between evader & pursuer--on the basis of a moderate advantage in the pursuer velocity over the evader and in terrain without obstructions--the evader is escaping the pursuer due to lack of the pursuer's fortitude, in a more confrontational chasescene scenario the evader is running toward the pursuer and is turning at 3.6m from the pursuer they are escaping the 2.1m conversational entanglement radius--gauranteeing evasion in every speleographic condition where such a branching configuration is accessible--, the contingencies of evasion are of an impossible complexity, so precisely elusively reliant on the encoding of devious opportunities in the simple interior architecture that remaining outdoors is a bestpractice, planning evasion is impossible, calculating evasion is impossible, reactive locomotion is most effective in asserting the body through closequarter confrontations, activation of the chasescene with an insufficient distance [△V·<T△3] between evader & pursuer in a straightline trajectory is developing an increasing closure of the separation where at separation distance ◇--requiring precise calibration, for an overly large ◇ the radiodrome is proving successful for the pursuer & for an overly small ◇ the conversational entanglement radius is devouring the evader--the evader is turning sharply and from the trailing distance the pursuer is turning on the basis of the radiodromic interception curvature, the evader is curving around the pursuer to a location directly behind them necessitating the pursuer's rotation in conjuction with forward momentum while the evader is continuing its evasive curving to remain behind the rotating pursuer who is closing the distance with each stepforward rotation in a dizzying collapse to the 2.1m conversational entanglement radius, the evader is allowing an increasing closure of the separation from the pursuer to distance [△V·◇]--requiring precise calibration, for an overly large [△V·◇] the radiodrome is proving successful for the pursuer & for an overly small [△V·◇] the conversational entanglement radius is devouring the evader--where the evader is turning and following a directly confrontational vector to distance [△V·<T△3] where the evader is lunging to a parallel trajectory avoiding the pursuer's radiodrome, windows are nearly opaque with thick cheese of cookingoil saturation and dustiness outside the curtain in what we are believing to be the Judas bedchamber is prying apart a relative slitting of darkness, the curtains are pinchingly clothespinningly fusing into singlesheets of pleatings, digital penetration of curtainvent, Judas defaulting in idling around Payriteskip is surveilling out from the dimmest nooks and hemmorhaging his black vestments forth from the most slender contactshadows of wall to wall & furniturefoot to rug, the isolation of his : pupils materializing blackcircling dawning from shadowedge drawing forth his black = nostrils and | pressing of his mouth around which the looming countenance whitewashingly translucently is opacating his pale cheeks and disconcerting forehead from the deminimis opaque lampshade lamplight of several rooms away, in such a manner we are believing the apertures of his pupils are occupying every vague darkwash in the overly dark interior & every shadowy volume of every shrub in the yard and consequently his entire body berobingly powdering black serge, succumbing to the paralysis of the footfall of dirt that is softer and more forgivingly radiating the scintillation of warmth through my rind, the sensation in the foreign yard that I am stepping on the regolith of home, not this place as home but a distant scab sifting into the grain of exilation, I'm desirous of the outlook that my relationship to all locales is equivalent but I've also knowledge of my death locale & my birth locale & the locale where I am happy & the locale where I am fully loving you Nadia & the locale where they are tormenting my body & the locale where I am discovering the truth of the Ktiya assassination, it's likely that no locale is culpable--whether good or bad--for these happenings but their enmeshment is existing nonetheless, this is the locale of my exilation, cows deeply lowing beyond the trees, deathgroans in wide whiteness of dawning with gibbous luna white overprint on white, not shadowcasting but thickly dark beneath the trees, from every murk and obscurity is spilling forth that Judas--translucent creature with inability of straying too far from curtaining and velour wallcovering--I see him in the fluting of fabric in my own clothing, I see him standing in an ajar doorway to a dark room that I'm entering unobstructed, the softness of his formation is scalelessly perching atop doorknobs & lying across baseboards & crouching beneath my tongue, we are finding a ladderback chair in the woods is missing rungs but serviceably sittable, I am looking away to Nadia is darning the elbows of a threequarter sleeve smock and in osmotic congress with her intense concentration I am dislodging my focal breadth in devotion to some laboring on the <<Letter to the Daemone>>, threadlooping and weaving whole cloth into the fraying absence from a continuous vector, Nadia's diligent fingertips in union with the action in isolation from the mind, where then is she traveling with that wandering consciousness, annihilation is not productive, physicality is beneficial, only the physical is possessing emptiness, the laboriousness of constructing a narrative of causality includes a tremendous amount of avoidance, threads of enmeshment are arising from coalescence of cognitive material is requiring passive swelling, drowning swarmings of activities are seemingly--necessarily--having more importance than occupying myself developing the causality of Ktiya assassination, an achiral & corroboratable solution of the mystery is incumbent on allowing percolation of these disparate mundane tasks upward into smothering distraction, I'm desirous of nothingness in my working, the working must be an activity of absolute emptiness such that no information of desirousness or emotion or dedication or intention or aspiration or curiosity or victory or defeating or affirmation or deathdrive or occupation or diligence or pride or satisfaction or joy is intrusive into the objectivity of indifference, the transcription of events--as a physical artifact--itself is inanimate, it is incapable of motion, this is not paralysis, its typology as an inaminate artifact is barring it from even the depiction of motion, but so many reporters dream of puppeteering words, their contructions dancing compellingly for the reader that they are orchestrating the rhetoric of their constructions to the extent that the reader is increasingly desirous of this tantalization in lieu of truth, my workspace is broadsheets of the Kirov epistolary manuscript pushpinningly covering the bare studwall of our murky little basement chamber in an organization conducive to productively syncopic squatting and rising, pages low on the wall are those with--what I am considering--higher valuations of achirality while those pages lower on the wall are more chiral allowing the maximization of my dizziness in standing up confronting those nodes requiring broader corroborative tetherment, factnodes are not alluring in isolation, the province of the reporter is not transformation of facts into something they are not through artifice through creation of an alluring mesh, not shedding the dull hulls defining the physiognomy of the fact for the promotion of their interlocking, reporting is not an operation of seeking but one of allowing, loose filling of passive textflow into the definement of an area by a kerb but not by a volume is piling and tumbling over itself is discovering locations of repose--not locations of fitting--with an odd variety of gravity that is not axial but a diffusion of meandering trajectories such that tinkling compactions--factnode grains--are tumbling in multiple directions at once, always across the cascade of other compactions but according to their own internal buoyancies, elimination of surfacearea through curling up dissolution of defining membranes, their objective utility is lost to attention deficiencies in dimensions unreachable from this particularly feeble genus of consciousness, with a status of adequate concentration I've certainly the ability of constructing the entirety of the meshblock in each of my encounterings with it, in that ideal status the assassination is solvable & the conspiracy is diagrammable & the motivation is banally human, the entire tale of Ktiya is one that is suitable for a corroboration although each iteration of construction is applying another layer of cloudy varnishing over an exceptionally opaque formation, deeper and deeper in this scenario is further and further from the centroid, an iteration is initializing upon rising from the chair or ceasing effort towards the active construction with eyes closing or looking away to an external phenomenon, any departure from the active construction is beginning the sintering, loss of the distinct toolmarkings of making, the ripening graingrowth of original microstructures into their neighboring cognemes, blooming open and coalescing to an unrecognizably ur solidstate in my absence, I am squatting in front of my manuscript on the wall, a construction that in its physical formation is static in my absence as a construction with tissues and nodes whose microstructure is fusing together into something inscrutable that I've the inability for accessing its depths upon engaging with its networking I am only apprehending impenetrable solidity--a sealingly abstract & ambiguously lumpy & exclusively scaleless botryoid amassment--that is pulverizable into components that are no more accessible than the whole, recomposing the pieces is only casting a fresh silhouette with no perceptible change in grain or superficial relief useful for thoughtful extrapolations only clatchings of adjacent material that are losing their distinction from the amassment with the initialization of a new iteration, the danger is in the neatness of identifications, retreating & withdrawing, unique fleshy wholes appearing and petrifyingly suppressing the actions of their construction, reporting is the confrontation of a wholly alien yet intimately familiar awareness, my internal musings are ephemerally pliable & mutable & imperfectly formless gaseousness, the confrontation of a physical product of my intellectual efforts beneath the ossuary deposition of many iterations is the confrontation of an immutable & precise fragmentation of my consciousness, peculiar & external, the curious fascination of examining a mucolith--a production of the body's inspissation that upon extraction from the sinus is not part of the body--inscrutable & obscurantly simple yet familiar in a very frustrating way, is that truly what I am feeling inside me, the formal properties aren't in keeping with my expectations, it is seemingly smaller & less impressive, this unfamiliarity is not escapable, musculature growth through healing of woundings and tearings, adoption of a contraposture that is traumatic to the musculature, lying on my back with feet on the wall inching my shoulders toward the wall and walking my feet upward while maintaining a vector through legs and spine, cogitation is dubious endeavor, I am fleeing the labor I'm walking or at the very least the imagining of walking, it is my understanding that the active consciousness and the physically active body cannot coexist, the ordeal of conceptualizing the mechanics of my reportage on Ktiya is actually biological because the distillation of gemstones in creation of little armatures for a textblock is occurring without intellectual labor is only arising from walking against which the consciousness is absenting, perhaps it is something spawningly within the rhythm, or is it actually something cellular or metabolic transpiring, is an idea a physical thing, is it in possession of a chemical infrastructure, geometric pursuit evasion is not wholly effective, remote sensation of footstep identification is the safer & more conservative method of Payrite avoidance, establishment of correlation between distance & loudness is training the mind into rote responsiveness enabling my involuntary navigation on the basis of subconscious auditory information processing allowing my free movement around the dwelling--but only the interior where footfalls have resonance on the flimsy construction of artificial woodfloor drumhead & pressboard resonancehead tackingly to joist undersides & faux antique goldleaf and velour wallcovering over 5mm sheetrock--, underlying pursuitcurve geometries enhancing the auditory method are providing potency to worldline prognostication of data is banishing Payrite to <<elsewhere>>, most crucial is the distinguishment of each footstep voice, Payrite's unctuous although effetely shuffling gait is identifiable in the burnishment of his calfleather slippers materializing sforzando in a location out of silentness attacking across the woodfloor is seemingly appearing in various parts of the house without any circuiting between, Nadezhda's is identifiable as diminutive Nadia in motion on her wedgeheels heeltoe heeltoe tiny fortepiano microbursting heeltoe her arms swingingly propelling the burdenment from her legs on each footfall allowing the rudiment of her footbones through the thick soft sole contacting the woodfloor into multipart pataflafla, most enigmatic is the fluid arrhythmic flowing riverine crescendo hissing persistently across its entire watershed everflowing streamingly--the vastness of the sea in a sylvan creek--across the woodfloor with long diminuendo streaking to nearly inaudible échappé trickling,unceasingly drizzling, fleas are hopping everywhere into nebulae of visibly aerosoling vectors broncriding on droplets of moisture, typhus raindrops are forming solution with pyresmoke of cattle incineration, zoonotic precipitation, the urgent bloodpressure of cognition is driving me toward my tackboard wall of Ktiya material, perhaps my tumescent motivation for solving the assassination and fallout meshblock is the persistently inane superiority of the Judas landlord, embodying all elemental characteristics of ADA tufthunter mollusc hordes enabling the administrative narrative--hungrily ingesting the most byzantine infrarationalizations--of the assassination of Ktiya and enabling--embracing & violently promoting--the administrative terror disingenuously responsible for stanching the inevitable torrent of molluscal bloodshed resulting from the feeble adjudication of Ktiya's assassination by instead overreactingly--where there's no imminence of torrential molluscal bloodshed--instigating the administrative death & eradication of all Methodists, the exilation of Nadia & I, the execution of Anna, the madness of Marina, solving the meshblock of Ktiya's death is also the imprisonment of Payrite in that guilt & complicity, Nadia is devising a novel method of folding our clothes that is displaying them effectively in an open crate, her delibaration is consuming and is warming my skin and hairline is prickling, we are whispering nodes of the assassination back & forth, hypertrophy, encouragingly increasing bloodflow to muscle repairing and away from the brain, bloodletting for lowering bloodpressure and euphoric sensations of decreasing bloodflow to the brain, I am finding particular strange postures are encouraging lucidity, sitting in a casually reclining position and I am quickly rising to my feet and locking my knees and swooning flowingly through a rote landscape of mnemonic nodes firing threads one to the next with such woozy clarity, my production is coming not from strength but acquiescence, I am falling through intangible nodes of information, the artifact of the existing opus body is the inescapable terrain of action, that artifact is the datum of my departure and I'm finding it something else entirely from what I'm preparing for interaction with, ridding my consciousness of the necessity of physical action--although it is necessary--it is the most repellent aspect of settling into my laboring--actual working--because taking action is physically decisive it's tone is conspicuously desperate, concentration on the physicality of working is failureprone, blackclad body hanging in a closet is atomizing bilious decayal from its threadbare tunic into a dewpoint saturation of black sludge vapor, kissing her neck beneath her short hair with my palm on her cheek and gripping her like a little boy, the vapor droplet nuclei hanging in the air each with black atmosphere is thermally expanding voronoically filling the closet not with solid black but with casting of blackpowder ashlar, fragrant ashlar of lightless deepseawater, from sweepless closet doorbottom is venting the aromatics into the doldrum hanging patiently in the air forming tendrils of its particulate loneliness are wafting through the dwelling where I am rising from my workspace desirously woozy on narcotic aircurrents from a redolent prismatic censer of seabreeze swaying forth saline black haziness is falling across my attentiveness to the endeavor, creepingly through the dwelling interior, the saltiness beneath Marina's hair, down the stairwell into our basement chamber fluid viscous smokiness is carrying an ecstatic poison operating agitatingly on the pyramidal motor system, weaving through our scattering of furniture--pallet, chair, openface sideboard--toward the vague window toward the thin door up onto slick dusty concrete floor and the bottom creaky stairtread the black invitation is slenderly threading through my nose and coiling in my lungs to the landing at the garnet leadglass frontdoor projecting radiant cinnabar bokeh polygons are blacking out ahead of my ascent into the hallway is black at both terminals, at the top of the stairs Nadia is crouching in the stippling of watery red darkness projecting from a highback chair, and our eyes locking with assertion of momentum toward the origin of the magnetism I'm collecting her up with me in my swinging through the kitchen into the hallway toward the parlor where Judas is crossing the hallway on a trajectory toward the kitchen that is deflecting us tangentially from our path into the parlor on our hands and knees behind the furniture and back into the hallway ending in a niche containing several doorways, we are together opening the darkest doorway into a deeper darkness whose underlying hue is shifting from the weak goldenness of the main dwelling to brackish aquamarine although still black, aquamarine with the dormant potentiality of bioluminescence is delineating a single bedstead on a wood frame & a writing desk beneath a square of drapery & a closet door with a folio of black--vaguely varying blackvalues of dustiness in the seams--tunics inert hangingly passive, Nadia is reaching between the hangers with prying apart outwardfacing fingertips is opening an aperture in the black labia for herself with saline static crackling of the coarse black fabric is healing around Nadia is disappearing into the closet whispering for my coming behind her into the stale depths of the closet my dear Marina is standing a proud barely physical crumpling together of blacklace is forming aspects of her countenance with thickening layers of moire, the enigmatic resonance of flowing streaming is approaching through the parlor rushingly tidalbore is collecting fluid tracing toward crescendo and Marina's bedroom door is shutting--thunderclapping--an airpressure surplus into the room puffingly coaxing illusory auroral firmament rosy & serene & immaculate is scrolling up from the doorbottom is filling the closet coalescing into the fulguration of a brilliant pointsource countenance squintingly gentling its luminosity through the tempering haziness of anthostratus veiling her short hair--hanging over pale olive baubles in her ears--ensconcingly in white reticella cowl beneath a green mantle draping across her raiment of alive ember red smoldering through the black folds of hanging garments, she is alive, Anna, composing myself, Nadia is deeper behind me in the darkness, every corpuscle of my blood is trembling -- No Weeping, Josef -- the dew of our collective breathing condensing on my cheeks running through with staining teartracks, Anna, alive, -- I am, I Truly am Anna -- , Anna, flesh, my weeping morendo into the dim togetherness, Nadia & Anna & Marina all in the dark of the closet with me, silently listening to Payrite shuffling into the kitchen & outside Marina's doorway & in the parlor a pale white countenance is floating in the darkness atop a gleaming serving charger is moving toward the top of the staircase,
