Nadia is lucid with the secrecy of her scalp in a loosely twirling scarf, it is pleasing to me that she is seemingly hiving her thoughts inside it, my thoughts, because I've no need for them within this geographic disturbance and lacking the focal tenacity for labor, it isn't that I've no trajectory or lacking the exceptional blankness of possibility, I've no occupation in Sannikov--not even housekeeping--, the buzzing is coalescing in a surgent opportunity for dedication I'm pushing away clutter and sitting and looking at the surface of the unfamiliar little table, rather than the factual network composing <<the Murder>> or <<the Assassination>> expanding to fill this opportunity is some nagging other preoccupation--coiling around a loose end that I've a compulsion for tracing back to its source, although I've no firm sensation that an actual terminus is existing or whether the thread itself is substantive, everywhere along its length is just fraying out fluff, but it is nagging and consuming--, bonfire smokiness is peeling over the white sky from beyond the silhouette palisade of harsh pine trees surrounding the Payrite backyard, the unctuous air alluringly permeating through the open back door of our room, I've the invigorating sensation of buzzing whispering from the vibratto of Nadia's prophylactic stubble and settling upon us in palpable thickness the miasma of an acrid yet appetizing suspension of meat scorchingly redolent for the two of us with intense appetites the accompaniment of such aromas is precipitation of ptyalism, and this salivation and this buzzing and excitement is indistinguishable from the discursive impulse toward laborious extraction and implantation--the composition of my <<Letter to the Daemon>>--between Nadia and myself, Nadia and I each dragging a chair out the basement door into the yard beneath a dead plum tree in a large flowerpot, jasmine effluvium is sickeningly thickening the fleshsmoke, my chair is facing the back of the house, Nadia's is backing up to mine and facing the forest, with our voices envelopingly focal we are simply chatting, Nadia is unfurling the scarf from her head and talking, the transaction is not measurable, she is telling me about explorations in the effervescent void of typhus & realizations about voices whispering in our dusty apartment in Tsentergrad & haltingly about the little bookshelf, its three tiers mostly empty because what desirousness for a book--the objectness of its involution--is outweighing the societal penalty of the neighbor is glimpsing the shelves through the ajar door, each volume the equivalent of blood running from lips gleaming in the invasive torch of the daemon <<apparator>> & about chestnuts in newsprint cones and the evocative charring of the pericarpus & catkins are gathering on our lips walking along the Kaw tickling our lips, leaning back my head to the high chairback to Nadia's head through the diamond lattice of chairsplats sensitively pressing my tingling pate to the clammy warmth of skin through her tonsure, a rarifyingly specific scintillation of energy, the sagittal suturation is unlocking dentation by dentation along the intimate unzipping of a slender gore is the formation of the parietal foramen, a burrhole of autotrepanation whose skin is peeling back engorging the pineal vulva where the rotating expression--rotating from my left to her left--of my falx cerebri is emanating toward the inverse rotation--from her right to my right--of Nadia's falx cerebri emanation are docking with one another with continuing rotation the same roation about the same axis relative to each other but inverse relative to our forward gazing twisting the hyperboloid onesheet of dura mater through the central diamond of the chairback, the conversation is meningeal and silent to informants are listening from the trees and inside the walls, only the disorganization of buzzing is passing through the canal, in the buzzing is crackling and the slumping of liquefacting biomass in flames, being one whose cognition is visual I am seeing Nadia's tacit communication with this parietal eye, sick humid heatwaves of smoak over Nadia is supping the saturation of its fleshy morsels hungrily, the forest is too thickly hot for a survivalfire--or the most frivolously ambient partyfire--, the dilating eye is unfolding its iris back around the globe, arising together from our chairs and venturing out from the yard through one of the gates opening into the forest, the irregularly nasaly respiration of an animal is panickingly sown with intervallickally nontonal <<breeeeeeeing>> & <<sqwaunking>> beyond a mass of shrubbery, atop a flaming cairn of typhic corpses charringly crumbling under more dying cattle, Nadia's cow, she is wheezing--without the presence or energy for bodily reaction--paralytic in the smoldering, her scalp & temples are lush with warm chocolate curliness is singeing in ringlets down to her skin beneath the burning away of her fur to an enormous offwhite marking rising--across the fissuring of necrotic jowls--up her bald neck is blooming over her snout is gasping soot rippling the surface of a mudpuddle where their crusty ashes and the rendering of their flesh is coalescing into the viscous potage of fat & blood & ash & saliva & sour soil, a man in plaguewear navigating a rusty pumpcar with a forklift attachment cradling another cow is approaching the cairn pyre--she is lowing gurglingly gasping at the suppuration draining through her sinuses from sores of black chunks from her face are falling onto the soil--switching the pumpgear to the lifter attachment his labor is hoisting the sagging cow up above the apex of the cairn where he is pushing her torso with a long oar collapsing down between the forks--the internal decoupling of her spine--she is folding over the top of the pyre and crushing Nadia's darling cow deep disappearing into the breathless embers, atop the reconstitution of the whole cairn the ignition of a fresh conflagration, a swollen sow snuffling around the crackling pyre is fleeing the squealing pumpcar forks are fangingly rising above him scurrying toward us, Nadia is weeping, the sow is diving between her legs and shivering, pinestraw driftingly partially obscuring a cube of concrete, the sow is resting with us in the yard on a pallet of Nadia's laundry is curling around Nadia the two of them sharing warmth and intimacy, she is more valid subjectmatter for Nadia's maternal energies than I and the appreciation of the sow is evident in her smiling & squintingly gazing into the sky under Nadia ruffling her short soft fur and scratching the base of her neck between her shoulders, the joy is contagious, my neck is tingling in sympathetic sensation, all of us fitfully sleeping--the sow between us with her snout on Nadia's scalp--in the dim afternoon quality of illumination mediation through uncleanable windowglass, shuffling footsteps intermingling with our trio of respiration harmony, diagrammatic sideview linedrawings of livestock dividing into the patching of an aperiodic tiling possibility or the reduction of a vital being into its culinary potentialities, her teats are engorging and discharging grey milky droplets tautly swinging and dropping spatteringly to the dusty concrete floor beside the towels & rags & brown weedgrass she is collecting and rooting around in nesting behavior into a dim and drafty corner of the room, teats dropping and swaying nearing the floor in her restless pacing around the room and out into the area under the landing outside the kitchen she is looking across the yard into the pine copse, scanning the panorama of treetrunks expectantly, cessation of agitation is incipient laboring, the farrowing sow is turning circlingly in her nest--tamping down and smoothing wrinkliness and lumpiness with her trotters--and laying down in the shreddings of fabric and becoming silent apart from straining respiration against abdominal straining exacerbatingly the sow is bringing her legs closer to her abdomen shiveringly is remaining in the straining disposition passing bloody fluid containing the meconium of her piglets from her swollen rubescent vulva is farrowing the first piglet, farrowing 13 piglets--5 stillborn, 3 starveouts, 2 low viability deaths, 2 crushing deaths from the sow rolling onto them during laboring, 1 viable healthy piglet--and the ropy glistening afterbirth radiating steamy warmth for her single small pig is shivering toward her teat, heavy rainfall in the green forest, the stench of death and birth in our apartment is so overpowering I am collecting the dozen piglet corpses onto a sheet and bindling its hemline up into a sack over my shoulder into the rainfall and green undergrowth into the dripping from the stumpy limbs and pineneedles each injecting single slender droplets viscous with sap beneath my collar, returning to the grave with a spade, returning to the grave with the placenta and umbilical cords, headstone of pineneedle disturbance and mud, the <<small pig>> is wallowing under the watchfulness of the prideful sow is lying in an arc around the edge of the mudpuddle, <<smallpig>> is sitting is sinking into the mud is grinning, her fingertip is perfectly nestling in the tender flesh between the heelbulb and dewclaw of her front trotter is absently tracing a latitude around the foot and ankle, the sow is audibly breathing with the vitality of acknowledgment by another living being is transcendent, footfall respiration sussuration of Payrite skulking to the window, concrete is the myth of meat or concrete the headcheese of stone, the patchy vegetation of Payriteskip is reflecting the sky in marshy pervasion of puddly oversaturation on the crackingly hesitant regolith is breaking down crusty clumpiness into thick mud deeper and deeper at the coaxing of the <<smallpig>>--especially cultivating and sustaining a particularly deep mudpuddle at the base of the outdoor staircase from the kitchen--is the perfect vessel for his immersion, Payrite is surveying the garden--minimal retaining of moisture from precipitation--from the landing outside the kitchen is descending the wavering wood staircase down the precarious ratio of riser & treaddepth is propelling Payrite into the mudpuddle, Nadia and the sow walking in the woods visiting the grave, the <<small pig>> is asleep on my feet, a laborer in coveralls is filling the mudpuddle with gravel drying and displacing the moisture, the <<small pig>> rooting in the damp gravel is lying in a small depression is digging in a frenzy fleeing across the arid garden into the forest, a cube of concrete atop the massgrave, 13 dead piglets, 

the <<small pig>> is rooting around happily in the distance squinting smilingly full of absolutely presence in the sunshine is settling into his good soft mudpuddle with only his snout & eyes & ears insular above the
