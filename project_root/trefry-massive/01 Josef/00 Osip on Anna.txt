fifthfloor walkup <<massive>> in Tsentergrad skyline circumference of <<massives>> delineating a bowl or fortification around the city, the apartmentlike silence of parchment, alone wandering we are in the sparse copse of pinetrees Anna is describing my death is precise and complex, her words are delicate and limpidly crafted with the warmth of a mother swaddling all of her darlings, it is hard not to feel her desirousness is the motherly nurturing of her grooming my neck with her tongue, this nurturing is texturing the portentous dirge libretto, that death is elegant stillness--inanimate under external forces, not an elective stillness but a stillness of physics, haunted by paralysis yet the impossibility of awareness of that paralysis--sculptural body, a wax anatomical figure is peelingly flayingly prostration on a satin mattress in a glass casket atop slender cabriole legs is displaying my corpse in La Specola, below the Giardino di Boboli, skin and viscera the color of a long Florence sunset, the wax forming the layers of my fascia are old, the wax is reacting with the air and the fats are sallowing, the Arno is gold, carvingly, down to my fat, I've a paunch in my deathcasting, my thighs rubbing together, slicing away at this curvaceousness to the imagination of a lither me, I am deeply loving, dissection with inefficient metal prisms--cupolae & frusta--operating at very small scales on my skin turning into ribbons--pyritohedron removal of eyelids, tetartoid removal of toenails & fingernails, gyrobianticupola pounding bones, truncations & stellations shredding my body, coagulating honeycomb of plesiohedra crushing and expressing liquids from my organs, incomplete honeycomb of gyrobifastigiums currycombingly pulping the tough meat of my legs, we both are scrambling over the railing onto one of great stony piers, the sun is red behind particulate haziness sinking into the Arno on axis with the Ponte Santa Trinita in the radiant lucidity of August twilight, the evening of my birth, the marble visage of <<Primavera>> is gazing up at us through the translucent riverwater amidst the rubble of the bridge is receiving my corpse is sliding off of a plank from beneath a satin mortuarydrape sinking, Siberia in conflagration lofting vaultingly peat smoak pillars into interweaving tracery into an imperceptible muting deflective particulate parallax, the twilight is settling on the riverflow limply weightless pollen, my arm around the small of her back and my hand conforming just below her ribs ascent through crisscrossing alleys out of the giardino, Bobolino, Baluardo, Cipressi, Mascherino, Madonna della Pace, and swayingly broad alpine boulevards, Machiavelli, Galileo, Porta Sante, my Cassandra unfurling a tale of my death in a transitcamp, all afternoon reciting Ovid, expiring in a flimsy tent in the night, thin clothes, no bedding, heart stopping, in between beats I die, I'm desirous of belief but I want to die curled up in a warm bed with a cool pillow in her arms, at the precipice of the Mons Fiorentinus on a marble bench in the piazza in bisection of crenellation umbra--emerald gown flowing into the sunlight across the marble terrace & the partial formation of her visage in the dim--a woman identical to Anna is gazing out toward the Arno in the direction of the Ponte Santa Trinita--an axis containing the Grotta di Buontalenti--the distant splashing of large ashlar granite is white in the riverine ochre, a slim vacuole around my body, sitting with my hands buried in my armpits, Anna & Nadia snickeringly querying -- are You Building Up Some Musk On Your Fingertips Comrade Stinky -- · -- He is Plotting The Ensnarement Of A Skunk For Dinner -- no -- I'm Simply Desirous Of A Physical Connection -- is my inflection of the pleasant conversation toward awkwardness, Nadia's mouth is straightening into a small hyphen toward Anna is holding a scarf toward the sun casting her face in tingings of chartreuse & pink & fuschia & puce shadiness, nobody is touching my skin, I'm imagining the scenario--not the sensation of physical connection--but the liberty & openness in the panorama of my being to that type of intimacy and tenderness rather than prudence & protection of cognitive intimacy, the porting of the consciousness into another consciousness rather than the folding of one body into another, my skin is at such a distance from my emotions that even tactions of endearment are physically painful, in the elevation of my anxiety the caressing of my skin is resulting in the recoiling of the Daemon himself is gripping me with avuncular disdain, my entire consciousness is in devotion to the mechanics and machinations of the murder not because the solution is promising my redemption--much the opposite it is insurance of my erasure--but because it is a definitive and reliable moral centerpoint, she is lifting her shirtdress up her thighs and lying back on the rug, her hands spanning across the door opening climbing onto me we still are smelling of the autotransport and long journeying that is ending in the evening with the reinforcement of physical separation resulting in the most entwining unification of bodies, consequently my tendency is seeking establishment of a sphere of emptiness around my body or folding myself into myself--either cognitively or physically--, I force a pillow into my mouth as I am sleeping, I'm sleeping on top of the bedclothes, I'm intentionally unresponsive to questions that are reasonably seeming inaudible, I am attempting the disappearance of turning grey, I am an old dead tree, not because of a necessity for distance from the people I'm adoring but the necessity of distancing myself from existence in general, survival instincts are unambiguously restrictive, the pineal pedicel is sprouting--birthing forth a profusion of formless potentiality, the organelle itself is not visually defineable only existing as a descriptive atlas lolling at the terminal of a silver cord--from the bridge of my nose searchingly into the vacua for one Anna any Anna alive Anna with an alive Josef, uncommon in my imagination is the recognition of Anna as a physical entity, she is diving in and breaching out of my awareness, our interactions are operational with the pure independence of parallel systems, our occupation of the same room is a sensation that we are on rails slipping us back and forth but not toward, our touching is fallingly endless hurtling in relative stillness, Anna clutchingly in my embracing an air cushion between us, vital molecular composition is prohibitive of two humans touching not passing through each other but electrically charging the emptiness between my nuclei repelling the electric foam of the emptiness between her nuclei, but this electricity is extant even in the corpse thus it is the vitality of the nucleus as a vector is causing the inability for reconciliation of my fingertips sliding up to my knuckles through her hair, I've the impression that I've the ability of touching a vital being signallingly drawing my fingertips toward warmth, yet upon Anna the sensation is a vague pressuring of resistance and something like a breeze or a tide, is touching the tide possibly, is touching the sea possible without touching the tide, is lovemaking possible with a digitalfile, bodies in a massgrave, skeletons embracing ribcages fingerjointing, is reading a volume of writing possible, what is the physical printing of writing in its becoming part of the consciousness, can translation arrow toward intangibility or ephemerality, siphoning vitality is necessitating the enclosure of a receptacle frothing with textual potentiality, something is not going nowhere, is rereading that volume while in possession of the textfoam spitting some of that intangible translation back out and licking it back up from the physical printing of writing, that spitting is spitting of a translation housingly in the volume of the skull with no possibility of sequestration from all the other translations of writing & visions & desirings & sensory imprintings are coloring and shaping the textfoam, there is no hermetic or selective valve into the consciousness, Nadia is containing a duplication of my consciousness as well as her consciousness, I am receptive to containing her consciousness although it is solidstate and paradoxically is containing the inaccessible code for its duplication, everything from my brain inside Nadia, in its porting into Nadia is it translating sloshingly into otherness, is recognition of my consciousness possible from without, memorizing the text of my letter to the Daemon is a very different situation than the lively tissue of those words inside her brain, even the rote assembly of the letter in Nadia is only a kernel, a pearl is accreting, the extraction of its true form from within her is impossible, only what she is allowing is accessible, only her presentation of my consciousness back to me full of elisions and paraphrasings, am I even desirous of what the corruption of me is becoming in her, perhaps what she is returning to me is a behavior, is behavior that product of all the digestion of things in the brain, what pathetically meager grit is the collection of words I'm insisting into Nadia in comparison with all of her personal reflections secret beneath the tarpaulin I'm imposing over them, is Nadia desirous, certainly she is, and Anna is desirous many other things than me, -- Where are You Imagining You are -- · -- I'm Not Certain -- Anna on the pallet in our basement apartment beside the sow -- is It Balmy -- · -- Yes, But Comfortably So, And A Soft Breeziness That I'm Aware is Consistent By The Surface Quality Of A Waterbody -- · -- is It Ripply To The Extent That No Reflection is Visible -- · -- I'm Not Certain -- I've awareness of the length of her hair only through my intimacy with Nadia, she and Nadia are wearing headscarves in each other's company, Nadia is visible through the window at the base of the exterior stairs, I'm attempting speech with my gazing an entreaty Anna that you are removing your headscarf -- It is Similar To Looking Through A Sheet Of Sheer Fabric, Rippling From The Warpthreads is Dominant In The Orientation Of The Riverflow -- · -- It is A River -- · -- Yes, That is My Deduction, The Weftthreads Of Rippling are In The Orientation Of The Airflow -- her fingertips are tenderly inscribing latitudes around the sow's ear who is snoring

Who -- · -- It is As If It is Gazing At Me From Beneath The River -- · -- are You Alone -- · -- Yes -- if I am uncertain that Anna is a physical entity why is it that I am in persistent terror of her death, us intertwining with pillows and cushions are pulling apart the materials of our grounding to the apartment in the massive in the city in the Adaemone are in the consumption of solar radiation flaring around the umbral obscurity of the planet is ash obliteration is coalescing in a cloudy smudging visible only from particular sidereal vantages in its partial occlusion of starlight, we are both dead, simultaneous parturition, my father is dying concurrently with me, the entirety of all luminance snuffing out except for a softfocus spotlight on the stubble of her hair, I am divesting the contents of my skull--where moths and rustiness are destructive--overwriting the vibrations of my work onto Nadia's perceptions of my physical being and the perpetuation of my vitality to Anna's methodical respiration, Nadia & Anna are not simply vessels, they are in fact containing something inaccessible to me, the ability of housing my consciousness while casting their minds solidstate fully apart from me, both fully of me and roiling with many others, is Nadia's somnolent grinning an outwrd indexing of private desirousness or more simply astatus indicator of her processing partition batchings into inert chambers awaiting my death, I am composting myself with the hopefulness my dissolution is providing them the nutrients necessary for leaving me behind, the apartment is dim, she is looking at Anna is in the yard lying back in a chair with a contraption of cardboard unfurling her headscarf for the creation of a large square parasol over her facial disc and chest, the ascending hemline of her long smock is just above her kneecaps and she is mouthing silently without unlatching her teeth, Anna's hair slick and damp from the misty Tsentergrad fog of our strolling long long through the streets and reciting to one another entire books from inside our heads, books we had read, books we wrote on the spot while talking, our entire uninterrupted conversation full of endless courtship, disinterest, harriedness, intense longing, fierce amorousness, distrust, dismissal, tender humor, filthy raunch, and candid shame, all that body of words, the greatest book of our lives, i will never read, but she, with her photographic scanning brain, can read every word any time, never stating that she is reciting it to me, but sometimes she says something to me that feels so familiar that i cannot tell whether she is saying it to me fresh or reciting a snippet of one of our long dissolved conversations, her eyes warmly porpoiseful--themselves a condensation of the sea from the darkest depths--and beadlets of condensing dew gather on her eyelashes and the tips of her hairbob collected into somewhat water repellent fronds--hair wax--and swelling larger and larger until the flowing floating sine of her gait plumps them free to trace down her neck into her collar as she wriggles with the tickling, windsweeping damp ringlets, awkward 4cm cowlick collection, sweatmatting of sickness, pillowmatting of lovemaking, asymmetrical hairbob, stubblescalp starry with scabbiness, why is our appearance so elderly, we are young, aren't we always this age, the <<small pig>> is trotting toward his mudpuddle beside Anna and Nadia are carrying chairs out into the yard are combing each others short hair in the diffusion of outdoor luminance, their possession by the fearfulness of fleas, absently brushing or searching the skin here and there, carefully scrutinizing the combteeth for nits, bloody fingertips, Nadia & Anna alternatingly speaking audibly on an innocuous subject while the other is whispering almost like ventriloquists speaking in the inhalation of one another between words, her memoir <<Nadia Against Nadia>>, Payrite dreading the omniscience of the ikons is relegating his guilty ramblings to dusty wastelands of domestic desolation so closely to our bivouackings that eavesdropping is inescapable, I'm fearful of what Nadia and Anna are hearing and what they are discussing in hushness and interspersion of dandelion recipe ideas, I am dead and assuming the burdenment of their knowledge without guilt or suffering -- The Aperture For

seascape her rostrum into the raininess is the most perfectly kissing tongue is licking my gold tooth whispering into my mouth, the three of us walking aimlessly loping through the neighborhood--sensations of liberation in diminishing bodymass with each footfall of increasing separation from <<Payriteskip>>--and arriving into the shadowcasting of the <<massive>> at the edge of the subdevelopment, tallgrass gently lollingly concealing any sidewalks or pathways from the roadway to the <<massive>> adrift rudderlessly at the mercy of the breeziness, its placelessness is a characteristic of potentiality rather than exilingly punitive drifting, the dwelling of <<the Neighbor>> is within the atypically embracing U footprint of the <<massive>> extrusion, all of the construction is dapplingly rinsing away into the dark background of the tall forest, with walkingsticks we are divining a pathway through the tallgrass to the lowest storey of the typical <<massive>> facade of concrete panels with leaveouts for windows are containing an additional concrete insertion in the window leaveout such that only a joint inscribing a square in the lower 1/3 of the panel is legible, the solidity of the concrete extrusion is an effective visual metaphor of the banal optimism of the voronoi, a belief in expansion as a checkpoint against dryrot doom, setback from one of the feeder roads and filling an entire plain out to the artery this massive, a strange relic of belief in expansion, the banal optimism of the voronoi, some expectation that construction of a beachhead such as this might attract the nearest urban perimeter to loop it into its territory, speculative construction, odder still is the idea of building such dense housing in such a sparse area where open space is abundant, shifting the function of the <<massive>> from efficiency to community & togetherness, yet as with most speculative construction it accruing more connotations of malaise than a productive catalyzing, the slick finish of concrete--indicative of minimizing production difficulties resulting from investment in a nonporous & durable formmold--voraciously soaking in ambient sunlight and radiating warmth is oppressively coaxing our ambling inspection around to the shady orientation of the <<massive>>, the caulking around an infill panel in one of the window leaveouts is dryingly brittle is pulling apart with rays of sunshine are pinpricking through the tissue from inside the solid mass, the radiance of entombment, crouching with eye to the caulkjoint Nadia is announcing -- The <<Massive>> is Hollow And There is Another Building Inside, A Small Dwelling, The Sun is Shining On It -- our Tsentergrad apartment where Anna is camping in the kitchen, a brightlight in our window, the melody of a ukelele from the neighboring apartment, recognition of the colorful fruit on the curtains I am carrying a loaf of bread up the long staircase, the parvenu translator David Brodski standing in the parlor is quite obviously an informant--I've knowledge of his renderings of the most popular saccharine literature celebrating banal musings are so futile yet every utterance about himself is swelling with pride--is lingering anxiously behind a chair as far away from the door as possible his smoking out smoak into the thin curtains is leeching into the sheaf of stagnant air against the window and creating a volumetric luminance is visible from the roadway from the shutting door of the auto <black mariya>>, the enduring image of Anna's scornful helpless fixation on Brodski her eyes urging on a forward tendency yet dead in their sockets where sitting slumping in the threadbare armchair--my armchair my homeplace--Brodski is entreating the ADA inspector for a visitation of the watercloset receiving a response in sad repulsion of -- You've Permission For Your Departure Home -- the secretpolice are perhaps more loathsome of civilian informants than we who are the quarry of their betrayal, Anna's fangs into my flesh, her taut & radiant skin supporting a smoothly evocative layering of soft yet thick marine waxiness yielding strangely to my fingertips that reaching a certain pressure the tautness becomes involution and my hand is passing into her body--not just through the slick waxiness but popping through the membrane altogether--not into interiority or containment that has an opposing frontier to the outer world but the sensation that through the skin is inescapable and endless otherness--a different set of physical properties altogether--, probing ammonium hydrosulfide cloudbands, the prober is encountering no solids or facetings in a 600 km freefalling trajectory, Nadia upon entering the room where Anna and I are laughing heartily is interjecting softly -- I'm Preferring Your Indifference That I am Here, Please -- in different rhythm and a different setting we are radiating golden auras, walking through the streets of Tsentergrad talking with Anna about Dante's exilation from Florence I'm hearing her voice emanating from the erasure of fogginess, our handholding continuous, dampness, slipping away, uninterruption of our conversation with her contralto throaty singing the mist beadlets are vibrating at this lower frequency, the fogginess is respiration inside her lungs where I am nesting in soft warmth freeing me relinquishing Anna's grasping to the pulsation of cold misty wrapping around my body and squeezing me singularly pulsatingly like a suit, i wonder about cutting her open, or finding her cut open lying in the woods and i am a small creature, a bird, what is the smallest bird, its ribcage itself wrapping around something else, microorganisms in its esophagous and I am crawling inside her asunder body--not dead--through bayonet wounding orifice like a highway through the mountains--a rail line through the mountains around the big freshwater lake the train itself passing through the mountains through large elms in open fields are giving way to alpine conifer stands the passengers within the train passing into the orifice of the mountainpass if the mountains are her knees we are all entering her vagina--all the collection of bodies into the wounding amygdalal gore where her entire corpus is peeling topologically--a problem of multiple handles, how is flattening acheiveable and is there possibility of lying upon it like a quilt for a picnic or does it always maintain some volumetric or topological porosity, my fleshy porpoise, what is becoming of those gasping holes when the sheet is flattening out, are they apertures, am I diving into holes for icefishing--as I am walking beside her she is disappearing realizing that she is immaterial and that she is a containment only of herself and incapable of admission of anything from me, different than Nadia who is containing my entire consciousness, all the transformations of Anna's body are incapable of manifesting a physiognomy that is all me or even at the very least a tangible body that is not mine that is something other than a mathematical code or filing system posturing as a physical being, she isn't much more than a mirror presenting back to me the things I'm desirous of while Nadia is opaque and a dull volume yet is containing me as a fidelitous reproduction within the stuff of her brain, beneath Anna's fingernails the yellow wallpaper is revealing the application of red pigmentation in her excavation of decorative layerings, our dwelling is dark with the umbrage of misfortune and dooming darkening the window treatments full of hexxing and administrative damnation, specular Anna, our births almost on the same day, my nativity, her nativity, so many greatcircles apart, nearly missing collocation in numerous instances, her inexplicable presence at <<Payriteskip>> is unsurprising, communing with Anna is an occurence that is ostensibly magic, a conduit existing in conversational delineation--what is the gridcoordinate of that conversation--that is magical, it is nonexistent, it is existing in the filings of her retrospective consciousness not in mine, it is only existing once for me, I've the inability of revisiting it, platterless, there is no official acknowledgment of our relationship, are we arguing--yes--but only in our loving one another, protectively, we are protectors of one anothers consciousness from the banality ADA administration, authoritarian systems are desirous of grinding down the privacy & inscrutability of consciousness, they are thriving on sweeping the chaff together from all the dustiness of all consciousness intermingling away the richness of the individual cognitive morphology, because thoughts do have a shapeliness and a composition, all cognition is the same material consistency but the layering and structural logic is encoding through different morphological paradigms of growth, the grinding away of that individual structuring is nothingness, not even a raw material, mindchum slopping into the eternal sea, my weakly immersive entrance into Anna is via mathematics--<<the Whitney Gambit>>--whereby understanding that the nature of my doublepoints--those selfsealing involutions & twisty appendages--is transversal I am capably removing these limiting selfintersections and isotoping into a boundaryless Josef is mapping onto an expectantly boundaryless Anna, even attempting accessibility to the insideness of Anna through these machinations devoting the cognitive processing necessary for sorting through the possibilities is a way of physically touching her even with the impossibility of doing so, two distinct yet simple dot configurations with inability of touching--only sliding across one another creating new & more complex configurations--, no superimposition of two gridpoints, the entire context of gridpoints and their relative, two identical people cannot coexist, a writhing & screaming amassment of subserous fascia invaginating out of existence, her hair is the awkward length of growing back from typhus baldness, I'm curious if my desirousness of her shaving it unnecessarily is persuasive, the stubble is revelatory of contours on her skin that are imperceptible in cleanshavingly or hirsute statuses, the vectors enunciating the topography in exaggeration of minor reorientations with splaying or converging angularity, the tactility is perfect, it is the only thing I've the ability of feeling, thousands of spearing needlings into my sensitive skin are dragging across me currycombingly eliciting a tingling reaction of the ilk that is prompting my doubting that I am experiencing it at all or just intuiting the sensations my gazing is eliciting, I'm craving this strange discomfiture, the visualization of stubble against my skin, drawing across it, studying it in the slowmotion of her movement, but it is the same luminous collaging in illusory media of childhood dreamscapes & fantasies, the consciousness is capable--similar to the physiology of the eye--of only focusing on very precise locations in the tableau, but in the consciousness there is no peripheral acknowledgment of a larger context, what is outside of aspectratio is not existing, the entirety of the body is not materializing without the roving of the spotlight across it, nor is the spotlight capable of maintaining the stability of the image, it must be in motion--this fragmentation is promoting the possibility that adjacent terrains are incongruously belonging to other scenarios--fragmenting completely different bodies exquisitely into the unifying medium of consciousness, but none of these are Anna because the imagemap of Anna is a construction from fragmentary imagemaps of others--things seen in magazines & childhood expectations & other women who linger in the mind more prominently though who may themselves be constructions from less primary sources--, I am not writing, I'm constructing, in construction is a necessity for material, construction is not something from nothing, such insistence on the magic of writing is disingenuous--or perhaps I am excusing my lacking vision by insisting that ingenuity is superceding imagination enablingly promoting the indulgence in consumption over inspiration or collation over improvisation--because all the materials that I'm requiring are extant without my conjuring, not within me but around me, they are undiscoverable via seeking, they are occurring, I am not curious, I am observant, the buzzing sensation precipitating my taking action on a textual construction is signalling filestructure saturation--enough material amassingly for my expectations of rich verissimilitude--, embracing consumption & collation into a batching of material is a failsafe reservoir against the selfdoubt arising from a dearth of productivity, the critical mass is enough for an undertaking although is manifesting a disappointing foray with perhaps a glimmering or two emerging cementitious with rehashing tropes & lienteric image egestion in physical writing of inescapable fixity, any ephemeral potentiality they possession of this amassing of consumption--locally luminous in the roving exploration of my cognitive torchlight--is now legalistically quantitative & inertly communicable, Anna is arriving for a holiday with Nadia and I in our <<massive>> apartment in liminoexurban Tsentergrad and not recognizing me standing outside the building entrance she is walking right by me, remaining silent in her passing, we are not embeddable, on the basis of the <<„Kolmogorov“ axiom>> we are topologically distinguishable, on the basis of the <<symmetric axiom>> we are topologically distinguishable in separation, on the basis of the <<„Tikhonov“ axiom>> we are distinct in separation, on the basis of the <<preregular axiom>> we are distinguishable in our separation by neighborhoods, on the basis of the <<„Hausdorff“ axion>> we distinct in our separation by neighborhoods, on the basis of the <<„Urysohn“ axiom>> we are distinct in our separation by exclusive neighborhoods, on the basis of the <<„completely Hausdorff“ axiom>> our separation is by the continuous functioning of exclusive neighborhoods, on the basis of the <<regular axiom>> we are exclusive collections and are not existing within each others exclusivity, I am hopeful my standing outside is giving me an opportunity alone with her on her arrival, it isnt that my appearance is terribly different--I am heavier and more curvaceous, my hips are womanly below my weak avian torso--but it is the greyness of my facial features are disappearing in the perpetually placeless haziness of this most damaging and tantalizingly hopeless exilation, I am silent, I'm allowing her by me to the entrance and listening to the wall of ajar windows above me--all gentle with hesitant life--for Nadia is welcoming Anna to our sad apartment, listen for Nadia's honest explication of my fate, delirium is fruitfully producing a rhythmic organization of luminous amniotic liquid, beyond thirst, a dehydration so pervasive and elemental that the complex tracery of the consciousness does not coincide with instinctual imperatives, my mouth is swallowing itself, Anna <<black angel in the snowfall>>, the interrogation chamber is banal, even contemporary, carpet, vinyl wallbase, a smooth door, tidy and orderly, three men in the chamber in greatcoats--two are sitting on a wooden table against one wall--one man removing his greatcoat is setting it in a corner beside the doorway where it is standing upright on its own, stiff, thick, containing the only shadows in the room, uniform illumination from above by four translucent rectangular lenses, -- Yes, I am Guilty Of Writing A Counterrevolutionary Satire Against The Administrative Faith & The ADA & The Daemon & Jsief Alpinist Leader Of The Adaemone And Its Administrative Hierarchies, And I am Requesting The Opportunity I am Writing It Down Separately This Satire And Adding It To The Documentation Of The Interrogation, the empty shell of the erect greatcoat is black, not the black of its coloration but the black of darkness which is distinguishable in that it is more of a gray medium, it is not a membrane, it is a space that I am entering with my vision is surrounding me, interior darkness is not the darkness of night but the darkness of human construction, I am inside the vault of the greatcoat, the greenness of true blackness, a large plastic jug of water is sloshing and resonant setting down onto the thin carpet direct adhesion to concrete, this location on Prechistenka where one odd cypress is thriving in a treewell I'm declaring to Anna -- I've Openness To Death -- , Anna asserting with characteristic succinctness that my satire is <<monumentally cheap>> is <<populist like a handbill>> & <<its contouring is a production of hacking with the pen>>, this disgusting & counterrevolutionary & libellous satire, a powerful concentration of poisonous society, she is not responsible for my composition of the satire, I am my own executioner, Anna gazing across the sidewalk is the reflection of my paralytic words of condemnation for her poetry are the lattice gripping my circulatory system, our conversation is a clay sculpture around that armature of guilt, <<she is not a poet but a versifier, a cold, cerebral compiler of rhyming poetry, they are cold & dead & not containing energy or faithfulness in the hierarchy of administration, the language of the poems is dark and complex, with an aroma of Pasternak, hardly paragons of clarity, reviewing these phrases is difficult, I've no appreciation or understanding of them, no evaluation of their possible significance or aptness, the systematization of imagery & metaphor--the abundance of piccolos & aeries--are characteristic of willful archaism, you're asking me if the printing of these poems is culturually valuable, I'm answering no, it isn't>>,
