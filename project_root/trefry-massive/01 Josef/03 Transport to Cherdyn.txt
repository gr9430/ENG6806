deciduous forest of behind glass breezeclicking, the last dry leaves clacking amongst the buds, a decidious bosk firm ashy in asphalt branching trunkenly from house to house to house, I am laboring to sit upright against the transport is diligently jostling against the imperfections and crossings of the omnidirectional track network and the overhead cable system is inheriting the will of the pantograph, blazing white sky is bleaching out—a flat banner from the headmolding of the window—liquefaction of saturation, figures in the dark, wan halflight, Nadia's fingers short and strong and masculine between my brittle fingers aching in collation but it is my hand that is in her hand, the limbs and branches and fine filigree of dissection breaking down the sky breaking down their own depth through the canopy thickness piling even through the pride of a single oak, it is our bodies in the transport is jolting at wirecrossings into the unfolding mystery of our destination, fishy conifers lost in bosk and endless houses, the vague shadow of the pantograph on a wall, sailing silvery toward a persistently distant lone mountain scarp, a lone conifer erect and proud with disease and desiccation in dry side yard is casting a vague shadow onto a waterstain running down false clapboards, the transport is breaching the edge of the city where the great boulevard Silesia axiomatic though unbeknownst beneath and between the library of apartment massives where our belongings lie in ransack and rifle—the small bookshelf leaning immeasurably my overcoat—green in the sunlight—a mug of tea dry mint and wooden spoons slanderous dominoes phony copies of my work in the frozen haste of panic masquerading as calm—high in one of their threatening shades whose edges are adopting the sky such that only at a point deep into the relentless geometry of domestic bondage is it apparent that something anything exists for its lulling subduction and phasmahedral windows bearing whatever protean incidence is confronting them, hardscape of stucco and styrofoam with fingerholes and fistholes discretely rectilinear but careless in global misalignment is receiving dirt from the vehicle of mist, passing no trees there are no trees at all, the sky is the presumptive border of cool fat in a can, the checkpoint portcullis is rising, I laugh--I have to laugh--at the fear, the transport is clattering on the track network amidst silent autos coasting sleeping riders winking at us in the sickly gray cabinlight of nighttravel instrumentation together all in motion is splitting off, the cortege of autos, an auto is splitting off from the cortege, the human head and the spherical cranium aloft, the transport is clattering Nadia's shoulder into my arm and I am not strong in doom is clattering Nadia is leaning into me is holding me up against the window wall with her shoulder in the dark, Nadia is strongly containing everything every word that every conversation every word that every notebook or scrap of paper that is mine and is only in Nadia is safe, in Nadia's hand in the dark I feel my own fingers, upon Nadia's weight and uprightness in the dark I feel my own absence strength, the transport is turning through a sidestreet to avoid an auto collision is clogging the downstream lane and tracks vee beneath debris and clouddull glass scree, a man is sleeping in his auto veering off into the sorcery of a subdivision, in the light of what is cycling away from dark through the silhouettes of trees shimmering and porous wavering with a light idyllic breeze blowing forth a powdery flesh of luminance bewitching black flecks of autos with details glintingly specular around the seeping twilightcast figures gesturing inside at the bankrupt green of the foliage and terrain refracting into hopeful saturation of thick green bushes and lowland mists aureate with flower stubble and flocks of birds intertwining a huge blaze of fresh lilac, the rectangular transport ribbon window is framing an enduring rectangular vista is not the sky but the surface of the earth is not a sphere but a quadrant and the sky is not a place but the planar face of a rectangular prism is transporting us and three silhouettes one in front one behind and one across the aisle, the wire network is stretching our over the asphalt stretching with the great and outreaching predetermination of the pantograph is navigating a wirecrossing, I am feeling fear endlessly in shells of smothering of the emptiness of everything is stripping away the diminution of each possibility the pantograph is reconsidering not the destination but the series of intersections and devagations, Nadia's fingers between my ribs, the roadspace is vacantly glaring niveous with a diffusion of light from all quarters in suspension around the silhouettes are leaning in to each other whisperingly sliding a hand between myself and Nadia, Nadia is my transcription with her fingertips and the enswaddling of her knuckle fibers thickening the creases on the obverse skin against my moist shirt is the persistence of coldsweat between my ribs the flesh is dry inside against the collation of her fingers are pressing a rhythm or encoding my bones with my own thoughts in words she is holding is repeating, the black cloaca of all ears sifting gripping themselves silent and inanimate only an orifice an embrasure a threshold is listening is triaging the private communication, all wall surfaces in the distance is all spacious asphalt and drygrass nettles weavingly through rails of boundary fences, the edge of mruky sky and full darkness is, I laugh--I have to laugh--at the lulling me through each possible setpiece of my execution lulling me to the peace that I am not being shot, I am afraid and in the snare of the transport is the predetermination of our destination in the program of the pantograph such that not even the silhouettes can be aware of where we are, the bobbing and oscillation of the transport lulling Nadia is sleeping above a crouching silhouette hand and knee creeping to her valise is snapping its fingers at me and taking the chocolate bar crinklingly conspicuous from my paralysis from the zipperless side pouch and breaking it into distributable thirds to the others each with a faint glare of grinning teeth, attendant black thoughts and black compositions are wreathing my viscera, I am afraid that it is eternally this clattering—the transport passing through a more narrow throat of a town center revitalization of automobiles in parallelparking slots and vacant sidewalks, in Nadia's ear canal the halflight funnel falloff to unlight, I am afraid—the light is crawling into my window ear, a vast stretch of grass and deciduous trees in hesitant bosks is unfurling the transport is devouring along a raised causeway through bogs vitiligous with white sky, a homingping of the transport from the austere and glossy ceiling, the musical humming of Anna's balletic body gunshot through the back of her neck in a pineneedle grave—her consciousness in oral samizdat echoing in coursing blood, the transport is slowing not stopping—an auto is deceleration into phase beside us with the passenger on his knees in gray light is watching me watching him reaching into a console and squealing and veering into a carpark around a motorcycle splitting lanes of opposing traffic, razorblades in swaddles of foil with visions of chewinggum of slicing through my gums unrelenting fantasies of fine and delicate dismemberment, I am trying to whisper to Nadia without turning from the window two silhouettes broadly are turning to face us one ahead and one across the aisle reaching out their hands to cup to Nadia's ear and they are whispering to her gripping my hand, the checkpoint portcullis is rising, a figure in black is lying in stratophyll umbrage, we have biases in the ribbon window is panorama, passing trees there are passing trees and buildings, through my reflection and lulling Nadia asleep with her head softly forward and ajar lips and silhouettes slumping in the gaseous half light of the transport interior the uninviting lightleaks and curtainvent stria of formless in the dark windows are coasting in odd patterns unbefitting houses one all alone or two in tremulous proximity but orphanly in vertical misregistration though all generally relentless in their subdivisional adjacency, a black ombre into Nadia's lips, the pantograph is passing over a wirecrossing lightly a throat swallowing a hand on a shoulder, only roads through the density of tree trunks, the black window is emanating cold through loose stitchspacing of the armhole seam of my thin jacket lining is trapping cold air against my shirt which is too thick and gathering under my arms in panechial knots whose sweat reservoirs, light pollution is washing the involutions of Nadia's hair is bouncing mechanically not watching out the window as much or at all, black lace pericardium, black sluice pericardium, infiltrational serous pericardial breach, in the sparseness tracks and cablecrossings in the endless easements intersecting endless vacant roads, the wavering branches behexen, long stretching nothing is the presage, Nadia is not whispering back Nadia is Nadia the professional suicide, the still air in the cabin with great weight behind elastically through the digestive tract of the transport circuit distant from Moscow and in more distance the transport is devouring the tracks ahead though its route is its destination is in the crypt of the pantograph housing and I am lifting my arms in the thin jacket but not above the level of my shoulders and falling to lay my hands on the back of the plastic seat in front of us the foreward guard is rising toward me—young silhouettes whispering for whispers of prizeworthy information back, the stripling moon is setting and the fields all around cloaking over with hoary gloom and reluctant sleep is pressing my eyelids down, the vista of silence the vista of expansive depopulation and of curtaining of encoffination the vista of masonite clapboard jalousie eyes the vista of twilight citizens pretending to go about their business with hypnotic regularity of their obliviousness to the transport to each other to the vehicles are passing them by and grazing them and their comfortlevel with this are lulling me are staying me from the imminent execution, the curation of byzantine directionchanges phasing the geography of the steppe toward my execution, Anna corpsing silently on a tumbledrift of stones, her corpsey blue of twilight, aorta conduit is leaving the heart into a network without surveillance in the everdiminishing froth of extremities, the curtain across the distant window is portending my doom, the razorblades in the heel of my shoe, Nadia's happy eyes and sad teeth in the window reflection over thin poles are racing past dust strata on black plateglass, deciduous bosk leafflush and raspy death rattly, early seasonal heat white night and dry wind against the window, cold sweat passing the dog is lying quietly visible over a fence in a desolate yard beyond the trees, coldsweat is slicking my skin and is pressing into my shirt against the hard back of the plastiform seat peeling away from my skin leaning forward with reluctance to seat back against the frigid clammy shirt I am remaining boltupright with a thin cushion of air between, the narrow aspect of a silhouette is lacking nose is lacking mouthcrease with the symmetrical pronunciation of earlobes a closecropping of hair the silhouette is facing me directly and is raising a hand into the half light of the window in the sickly gray fill light description of the transport cabin not a form in space but a flat etching of the fingers are jerking toward my face and snapping, my pupils in the stasis of endless constriction are capturing the vague calyx of life in the  only the cabin of the transport is stationary where the landscape and cityscapes and the whole of the territory is pivoting and rolling past around the prism of still air and light, the silhouettes are seeping in the half light, seepage into the skin unavoidably migratory through the bloodstream toward the heart and through the sheaths of every organ where their shadows are tightening and formfitting in assumption of the organ lurking as its bespoke corset holding and transmitting its secret chemistry and desire, the transport is slowing to a crawl alongside a crowd of men in mismatching soot livery pulling hats over their faces or hoods over their ears each reach into jackets rotating to face my flank of the transport, conifer copse evergreen, I am afraid of everything, a conifer forest is stretching endlessly shear trunk parallax flickeringly with dismal paint colors and simple gables, the bare skin of corpse toes and shins and breasts and ribs sifting from the undergrowth sparingly flickeringly in passage of pineneedle waveform, dense wreathing firs, rows of timber along causeway in the swale finger radially withing the allowable variation of tangentnesting cylindrical stacks and perpendicularly spanning logs nude of bark nude of branch or twig where a motorboat hull in a sheath of plastic is resting askew against the foliage abrasion of a sapling, my arms in shackles over my head and the constriction of my pupils wrenching into iris tying a knot and is not opening at the blazing spotlight, the rising and falling of Nadia's ear gently forward and down in the skein of her soft snoring unfurling the down of her hair is quaking into the dogear collar seamroll of her thick loden wool coat, sunscorch and ventifaction of argent utility poles, a utility pole split in two is hanging is bobbing on the catenary oscillation of its wires, the silence of a black storewindow I am not being shot, emerging from the lowland mist shawl I am not being shot, the ultimate deceleration beside a decompositional platform filthy with spalling and the sandy abrasion of wind, I am laughing, the sound of fingers snapping, my hands on my knees can I be stoic tremulous I am not being shot, Nadia I cannot see her in the dark but her pressing into my shoulder, a contusion of blue sky on the pale nimbus, the sky is visible above trees but only the walls of houses within, through the tendons in Nadia's wrist, I am afraid, the network is continuous I am afraid, along an impossibly straight causeway through mist weaving the flora and uprights racing past to mark the causeway collapsing from pallisade to partition in the distance, the causeway is high above a pampinpnigitic cruciform utility pole slumping vericose in the swale beside a windowless delivery van in rusty black disrepair in leanto nettles beading up wavering over its wheelbase, the tracks into curtain fringe of a caliginous calyptoplex swallowing us whole, the hairs on the arms with their shingle nap are a venthood admission point for clandestine eavesdropladen microdrafts are threading into pores and into capillary roottips detecting the pulse and pressure echoes of my giving up Anna choriolis around and around the circulation broadeningly to the aorta are proliferating all through the body are coagulating in sheaths around organs constrictingly, the small town is not dense but is passing and the dereliction is repeating beyond great aprons of asphalt crazy with sealant and failure in nettles, the silhouette heads are turning toward a bulbous tower eating into the sky with a relay of ladders ascendant to a cage and to a platform with a sparse guardrail passing slower than the structures lining the road where a man is unlocking a gate stucco a man is climbing stucco asphalt the ladder is perpendicular to the tracks and the facade of the perpendicular dim building in front of a man atop the tower is settling onto the platform watching the transport pass, Nadia's lips are moving with recognizable words that are the humming of my thoughts, the sound of fingers snapping in the dark,
