a manifold form in concrete, vanishing first churning and seamy with coldjoints keloid and crust dusty spalling in limey little spoiltips on the slab beneath, that in rotation is adopting infinitely different profiles against the sky and its boggy horizon by consideration of rotational lofting of a variety of crosssections each discernible in squintessence suppressing the portraiture of its involutional topography--at every point in the customary three extensional dimensions, concrete is manifesting the consternation of six inscrutable orthographic figurations tightly cincinnate in the single integral perspective of the terrain around the form--softscallops of gradual shade and the plurality of pointless shadowy outcroppings are flattening into a tonal composite of ashen grays native to the northmould and efflorescence mottlingly blemishing the field of the profile that is in possession of geometric proboscides and promontories belonging to manifestations of the other profiles available in other possible perspectives, standing on a hillock, lying in the grass, the peripheral and the oblique, the forgetting, the transliteration of a circular doughnut figure--a torus--is collapsing to a point, its surface is tearing open along a circular crosssection gapingly on both hemorrhagic ends with circular--onedimensional spherical--punctureholes, where gluey zerodimensional spheres--points--are geometrically styptic in the vasoconstriction reparation of the holes into the satisymptotic tips of a crescent moon--the diurnal offcenterness of the annular eclipse--are retracting in a redistribution of total surface area into a cashew nut figure, into a kidney bean figure, into the full equilibrium of a threedimensional sphere, each perspective everywhere extant, the peregrination of visitors, conscious or unconcious of and attendant or oblivious to the form, is cycling not only through the three extensional dimensions of the terrain, but is inescapably coincident with the cincinnate embodiments of the form whose deviations are so infinitesimal that--even enfolding scales between the pristine two degree fovea centralis and the onehundred degree vertical and--debatable--twohundred degree horizontal panoramic vagaries--the catalog of profiles is evolving and repristinate in inordinately iterative cycles, the insignificance of their profiles without the others, without the embodiment of the concrete mass is pulling down the slab into the soggy soil, is inappreciable for the grossness of the fleshy and relatively insensate visitors, the heavy clumsiness of any attempting occupation and paralysis of a particular profile alone, impossible, that in its cincinnate infinity, is simply a lump of concrete,

the urgency of resettlement, where rural landowners and ostensible serfs are without the support of the ADA, and where an urban infrastructure is not a presupposition of the withdrawal of rural support, the ADA is initiating an arduous reorganization of the construction industry, decreeing--without precedent in its sway over nominally private industries--that a progressive method of construction is favorable, is shouldering the construction of factories on the basis of standard architectural designs from the central construction planning agencies for the conceptualization of and massproduction of a suite of component parts for prefabrication as well as a parametric model for domestic aggregations into structures capable of employing these components as housing for the insurgence of desperate refugees with carrying their belongings in rugrolls, the smell of caraway of coffee of black molasses, in smazy palls of silica fuming batchingplants bespoke yet ubiquitous equipment for the prefabrication of sectional concrete building components is groaning is burbling, laborers kneeling to their chore rubbing lime on their teeth and gums are spitting in the mixers, the impossibility of comprehensive planning and comprehension of demands unknown sprawling over the sessile sphere cap of the DAemoneic demesne, voraciousness for resources of lime are compelling the catacombination of subterreanean excavation networks beneath cities--the stripping of sylvan overburden and scraping of fecund soils for the aromatic quarry--the fabrication specifications for primary construction materials especially large precast concrete panels sown with black mold scorchblack rye flour pulverizingly black pumice are purposefully overwrought for the accommodation of myriad possible applications--with safety factors allowing their erection in tiers of anywhere between five and sixteen stories or spanning eight feet over a standard allocation of seventyfive square feet per the housing norm and supporting deadloads of up to three panels for partitions at the discretion of the local domestic authorities or the surreptitious though tacitly acceptable will for further subdivision of the already tiny allocations--the mass production of precast concrete slabs is replete with raw steel embed plates in the field of their 4:9 faces and edge angles along their 1:4 and 1:9 faces allowing for the standard satisfaction of architectural prototypes as well as improvisational welding of the modules for intradwelling customization--hyphenating a room on the bias for uneasy modesty in coincidental coed arrangements, 

transports full of refugees springing ellishly through the outbound grid repatriating to the exurbs in dejection, few elect exurban houses still in possession of utility infrastructure are overflowing, waiting in dereliction, the desperation of laborers camping in the shells of incomplete structures, laborers are continuing to report to the jobsite of a small brick apartment building in the shadow of a precast concrete apartment building thirty five to forty percent larger, with rugs spread out under slumberers are drying the mist saturation from their outerwear in apartments--laborers are ceasing their attention on these parts of the building, seeing into some dwellings, coldness, corners are freezing, the panels over the entire surface of the wall hoary with icicles on efflorscent straws and nodules, gaps are appearing at the joints of the walls, through which the wind is blowing and dampness penetrating, with frequency, withdrawing, the window tracks are freezing, seeing in some domestic settings the ceilings are cracking and the floors concave, the facade of the Massive, with its insidious ornamentation of the intersecting seams between precast panels, with the resemblance of a grid--imperciptibly, though measurably catawampus--the image of an infinitely extendable abstract pattern of mechanical regularity is overriding local variation representing the formal schemes of order characteristic of ADA industrialization, laborers are rushing through their welding tasks without supervision, sweating through waistcoats under jackets under overcoats under other coats clusters of people are meeting in carparks are eyeing other small piles of belongings and moving into virginal buildings that appear distressingly old, the inexorable stream of anxious rural transplants, many of whom are squatting in hovels and corners of such limbonic permanence accruing modest lifetimes of appointments and bricabrac, are--at the urging of a local official erect in a stiff greatcoat--are seizing the opportunity are moving into a still under construction massive, they are suffering from mud or dust, the torrents and the desiccation, where the landscaping or maintenance of scrubby easements and shadowfalls among the rows of highrise blocks of flats is in official neglect, poor workmanship is causing many maintenance problems and buildings falling in nascent microdistricts are crumbling and failing in progeriatric disrepair with common faults of cracking walls and leaking roofs and thin masonry facings tenuously clinging behind wire mesh is preventing tiles from falling into the street, the panel dividing the sitting area from the sleeping area is tending to absorb natural light through stingy windows with flat blackness is distributing an even glare across its crust,

narrow lakes of scarification in combing arrangements are nesting parallel and concentric up to the bucket of a brutehulking electric shovel in poise of death is glaring our across the landscape of its destruction creaking in the mummification of benthic jeremiads, silos batching hoppers scales conveyors perching with furniturely hesitance on sandscape on bolts into concrete piers beside the austere metal shed building beside the barren yard with stacks and stacks stacking precast concrete panels, bespoke equipment--with byzantine sophistication--for the prefabrication of sectional concrete building components is chugging away even further outside the city, in concrete panel factories the elaborate conveyor systems are so complex that they are very inefficient, the ghostclink of gnathostridulous chainlink on cog on cog, documentation for delivery of seven million cubic feet of concrete per day is updating on the computer inventory system in the dusty glass administrative mezzanine, twentyfive hundred identical plants in clearcut clearings at the ends of dusty aprons are chalk roads, autotrucks barrelling through the grid, the voracious appetite for more and more and more concrete,
