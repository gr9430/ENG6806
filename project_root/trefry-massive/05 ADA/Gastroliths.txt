exposure of the fossil corpse of a plesiosaur--in bisection with half of its remnants missing from erosion--just above the crumbling base of a steep shale escarpment--in the windscouring of the surface layer are two dorsal vertebrae, several ribs, gastralia or bellyribs, and anatomically erroneous fragments of bonefossil amidst thirtyeight gastroliths of which half are within the figuration of the corpse and half are in suspension around the corpse--, the remainder of the discovery is lying within the shale tomb, Gallery of Natural Productivity director Lawrence Mare is on an exploratory excavation with dustbrush and with a small baster puffingly blowing small quantities of inhalation from its bulb into the furrowings of bone and tabular leaves of shale, shale under the fingernails, pulverization of shale in the mustache licking his lips in daydreaming geophagy, gastroliths inside crocodiles and penguins ballastingly neutral and irrelevant to their digestion, the plesiosaur licking a chalky escarpment savouringly in a milky cloud of soluble suspension and diving to the seafloor feasting on cuttlefish lurking in the silt is accidentally ingesting several quartz and chert stones is swimming dartingly and without undue buoyancy through crosscurrents with freedom and joyous equilibrium, its corpse breaking apart in cloudy salt ink of black bile and gut chum in strong currents falling puzzlingly to the seafloor, a total of 125 gastroliths in and around the corpse,

rock tumbler operators in private discussion are perfecting the combination of particular kinds of silt and sulfuric acid and seeds and cinching them into a lamb abomasum inside the mechanism for the production of adequately lubricious savourstones, tabular tercets in hendecasyllabic rows in greater arrangements contingent on the inclusion of sequential fossilbed discoveries geographically across the floor of the proportionally low and expansively broad--the floor is forming a horizon--bunker enshroudingly under obscurant drapery gentleness of thin linen contouring to prows protuberances pontic depressions niches domes of incomplete sauropod skeletons from across the ADA badlands and high deserts, cartographic matrices delineating locations of gastroliths and designations of the species of monster--Seismosaurus hallorum, Cedarosaurus weiskopfae, Dinheirosaurus lourinhanensis--and coordinates of discovery and primary hunter responsible for discovery and their restingplace on stainless steel downdraft autopsy tables--exhaust fans drawing down and away dust from the skeletons themselves although the volume of the room itself is not benefitting from the same level of ventilation--only a series of boreholes through the granitic ceiling at an exploratory variety of angles--, inner office doors locking the two men in ADA jackboots with a small Rayleather snuffbox--fingertips over the abstract desertscape of its scallopingly toothy toolwork--are turning over one in the right hand of each a pair of elasmosaur savourstones from the bottom of the Baldick Sea and leaning easily on either side of the glowing embrasure clicking their teeth against the perfection of polishingly impervious granite against the tongue and palate their gloss is slicking with ionic bondage of saliva production lubriciously satisfactory, from each table a clawtag with tiny ideogram depictions--in the unmistakeable hand of «the Steward»--is defining the distribution of gastroliths within the reconstruction of the skeleton including their weight and species of stone and general physiognomy--ovoid, spherical, tricylindrical, polytopic, configuration 3.4.4, configuration 4.4.4, cupolar, obround--of thousands of partial skeletons lying stately in the bunker only a meager percentage are hosting the preservation of precious digestive stones, those in possession of more than a couple of the gastroliths are in superabundant and widely varying possession, the elasmosaur corpse deep beneath the Western Interior Seaway is bloating with the accumulation of decompositional gases in its abdomen is floating to the surface--«the ol bloatnfloat»--with extremities forcefully at gassy attention across the surface where sharks are munching and birds landing on the adrift island of its broad back are nibbling through its sloughing skin to the cold and salty meat--analogous to the fudgy tartar of whalefish--its lower mandible is falling away from its skull sinking and its skull separating sinking separately and inconspicuously to the seafloor with the sequential deterioration of the vertebral ligaments each bone in the column is tenuously loosening in the softening offgassing sinking monster to the seafloor headless, that the stones are within the corpus of the monster is inarguable, structural branching tubular capillaries and gastric arteries in the preservation of the animal proteins collagen and actin and tubulin steeping in their own hemoglobin at the bottom of the sea or in a shallow stone depression are cagingly lacing fanvaulting above the smooth stones or in the case of skeleton KJFE 216815 within a hall of arching ribs, that the residence of the stones are foreign bodies and the product of intentional ingestion is inarguable, why the stones are lying in the corpus of the monster is extremely contentious--functioning as a gastricmill in sauropods and as ballast in plesiosaurs, or just the pleasurability of lithophagy--and a crosssection of autodidacts with daypasses to the bunker are asserting «No, the polishment of the pebbles and stones in association with the sauropod skeletons are incongruous with the lack of polishment in avian gastroliths» and «No, the abrupt rupturing of the elasmosaur cadaver and accounting for flowrates and waterdepths in the „WIS“ is incongrous with the scale of the debrisfield of stones» and «No, the relative mass of stones and monster corpus--1:5346--is wildly incongruous with the relative mass of stones and avian corpus--1:11»,

«the Steward» is eating his lunch of seedy porridge and tongueprobing nettlesome seeds along his gumline is consulting the matrix and is selecting a table gingerly peeling back its linen shroud is extracting a smaller stone--dotting its outline on the mirrorplating with the felttip of his pen--that he is placing in his mouth--dry and round nearly tricylindrical with filletingly soft points ideal for postprandial sucking of this particular prandium texture--and turning over with his tongue carefully belaying its momentum toward the interior faces of his teeth but easing nudgingly along his gumline, the points of the stone are not fine enough to dig out the food between his teeth, the action is fluctuating saliva through his mouth and the oscillating friction from the intermittent matte surfaces of the stone against his gingiva is liberating the small seeds and--pressing the stone atop his tongue to the roof of his mouth--he is savouringly grinding the bonus morsels between his molars,

the most compelling data against stones in the gastrickmill functionality hypothesis for sauropods is coming from extensive documentation of experimentation on wild mataeopterae--literally «useless wing», or nominally the «great plush Ray»--the only ratites indigenous to ADaemone--who, analogous to all ratites, are not in possession of a crop for digestion but a cecum peristaltic with enzymes and a muscular gizzard containing a wealth of gastroliths tumbling over themselves and processing seeds and grains in rhythmic grinding contractions continuously audible from outside the bird and visible in the quivering of fine down on its rump, researchers are selecting an assortment of stones--limestone, granite, rose quartz--for administration to the wild Rays with necktag identification and occupying the erection of habitats of husbandly constraint, strolling in for silent slaughter with careful sorting of gizzard and proventiculus from the glop of offals and screening and washing the stones researchers are gauging duration of digestion against loss of mass and deviation in morphology from the original stones--the execution of small thumbnail delineations for comparison--, the resultant of this perpetual grinding is however a stone of a distinctive porous matte quality with no polishment--a persistent argument is involving the impregnation of encoffinating silt with stomach acid creating an ideal polishing medium--, a fourth controlgroup of Rays is digesting indelible black chert pebbles, both the mass and morphological transformations of the stones as well as relative mass ratio comparisons--beast:stone and bird:stone--illustrate negligible functionality of stones in the monsters despite strikingly similar quality of stones--a light polishment is approaching that of the fossils but not quite so pristine and impervious to coagulating layers of salivary jetsam--,

analyses on the gastroliths of wild mataeopterae illustrating similar qualities to the preciously scarce savourstones of the sauropod and elasmosaur are rationalizing the explosion of countryside industrial mataeoptera farming--the fleshly byproducts of their digestive pebbles becoming ubiquitous in broths, leathercraft, liquid eggstuff, meats suitable only for grindage, and feathers for downy greatcoats--in long barracks where the majestic birds are in restraint of stocks around their thighs, the cauterization of their vicariantly vestigial wings and the clasping of long rigid tubes the length of their necks up to the background wisdom of their black eyes with connection back to a hinge that is lowering for feeding from a moldy bucket, and--with the contraversion of their instinctual dustbathing and scratching their lovers necks by braiding caduceusly together, and the pertinent stoneswallowing--their supplemental diet of rocks is via forcefeeding through a funnel with fingertips pressing over their velveteen nostrils--perpetuating and expanding under the auspices of the ADA until the seizure of a cottage industry of blackmarket artisinal rock tumblers by municipal authorities is reactivation under a more bureaucratic centralization of ADA indorgpsych--with consumption of more human laboriousness--is stripping the viability of the more durationally inefficient natural process and all mataeoptera in captivity--in excess of 215,000 in a mass extermination--except the liberation of one in the darkness by a desperate undercover veternarian whispering «Harald» watching the majestic bird limping into the sylvan selvedge--and the stockpiling of their stones in a manmade cave,

«the Steward» glibly with three of his favorite savourstones clicking against his molars and canines turning barycentric around his tongue discovering a small seed between his incisors is working its apex in upward probing against the unforgiving seed tossing two stones over the tonsillary precipice into his trachea dying alone of asphyxiation in the crepuscular fringes of the cavern,
