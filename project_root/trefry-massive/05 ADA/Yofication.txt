the societal positioning of language in the ADAemone is in persistent devaluement, administrative assaulting the validity of language or its ability for representing complex interior terrains & relationships ( -- The Wondrousness Of Creation is Potential Extant Within A Description, But The Mechanisms Of The Heart are Functioning In The Heart Alone, Attempting Their Representation is Foolhardy-- ) or its fidelity (either in specification or spatiality or directionality of physical terrains & relationships) to the physical world, the application of language as descriptor or epistolary (all communication is verbal & in situ) or enchiridion (manual or guidebook or handbook or tutorial or summula or chrestomathic or vademecum) is overburdening the essential valuation of the grapheme collection (rejection of the term <<alphabet>> is also crucial due to its portmanteau etymology deriving from the first two graphemes of the Latin alphabet) which is simplicity, with a superabundance of graphemes the temptation for improvisation with a language is becoming unavoidably risking sacrificing the clarity of the language for the usage of the entire citizenry in identical applications of the language to their basic requirements, formation of the <<Congress for the Glorification of Linguistic Elegance>> is an entity whose responsibility is the careful analysis of the valuation of each grapheme for its retention in the <<civilscript>>, the initial collection is containing 45 graphemes (the contemporary monarch (Pyotr I Alekseyevich) sitting in his parlor pulling clenchingly great velvet drapery is lighting several oillamps around a large wingback armchair and across a lapdesk is sitting with a large wood plank or tablet with a gridding of all 45 graphemes (9 columns of 5 under transparent (sallowing) lacquer) is crossing out graphemes with a dryerase marker in a not altogether haphazard iterative undertaking is ultimately arriving at a collection of 26 graphemes through the removal of the 9 letterforms that are recognizable in the Latin & Greek alphabets (O, M, T, A, X, H, B, P, E) in addition to Я with an obviously nationalistic rationale, an additional 9 strikethroughs (S, Ѯ, Ѱ, Ѡ, Ѧ, Ѫ, Ꙛ, Ꙙ, Ꙝ) are on the basis of the perception that the vocalizations are representable with remaining graphemes through their context in morphemes, this proposal (production of a lithograph directly from the tablet is enshrining the preferences of the monarch for streamlining the grapheme collection as a reference for the <<Congress>> (the original 45 graphemes are scripting the performance of 70 phonemes such that the proposal is reducing the lexicon to morphemes utilizing the performance of only 44 phonemes and the tremendous loss of expressive vocabulary (including the word <<god>> which is prompting ecclesiastical leaders are condemning the proposal as blasphemous and the monarch as the antichrist))) is the subjectmatter of the first <<Congress>>) from which the first convening of the <<Congress>> (or <<Confogline>> or <<Coft GoLiE>>) is adopting the less aggressive removal of only 9 graphemes (S (or <<dze>>) & Ѯ (or <<ksi>>) & Ѱ (or <psi>>) & Ѡ (or <</o/>> (the modification of the conventional <<o>> vocalization through endolabialization)) & Ѧ (or <<yus>> (or Ѫ (or big <<yus>>) or Ꙛ (blending of the <<yus>>) or Ꙙ (hermetic little <<yus>>) or Ꙝ (or iotation of the hermetic little <<yus>>)))) with the attendant retention of all phonemes, the second convening of the <<Congress>> is occurring not by royal (the monarch is dying of poisoning from high concentrations of urea (sepsis from a gangrenous bladder) in his bloodstream) summoning but through the machinations of the infiltration of the nascent Daemonic movement into the mechanics of societal administration at the behest of Zangief as an avenue for increasing (according to his rationalization) the mystical significance of the grapheme collection by reducing its quantity is pressing the populous (according to his rationalization) into linguistic & expressive refinement and the ascendance of metaphorical tissue at the resolution of the grapheme rather than intermorphemic tissues of metaphor whereas as with most administrive incentives the effects are enhancing the administrative puissance for suppressing expression & dictating the modes in which its citizens are actively engaging with the world around them (quite the opposite of metaphor), an additional function of the second <<Congress>> is determining the validity of the grapheme Ë ((or <<yo>>) is the rediscovery of an apocryphal grapheme by Nikolay Karamzin (declaring in subservience to the administrative restriction of language that -- Living is Not The Writing Of Transpiring Events, Not The Writing Of Tragedy Or Comedy, But Thinking, Feeling & Acting As Methodically As Possible, Loving Benevolence & Purity, Rising The Identity To Its Fount, Everything Else is Husk -- ) who is fabricating it for the realization of an impossible rhymescheme in a poem (rhyming being crucial for memorization as poets are avoiding writing down their poems especially if the material is administratively questionable although in this case the poem is not questionable (the poet is a favorite of his contemporary governing body)) in his poetical almanac <<The Aonides>> is containing the poem <<Sophistiation of Solomon's Wisdom, or a Selection of Thoughts from Ecclesiastes>> where the rhymescheme is necessitating an entirely novel orthography (the phoneme itself not being novel throughout the development & evolution of the language but its representation by the grapheme E is producing the necessary inflection depending on where it it falling within in a word)) ultimately determining (in conjunction with the elimination of I (or <<ee>> (the common high anterior angular vowel)) & Ѣ (or <</æ/>> (the modification of the conventional <<a>> vocalization by raising the lingua)) & Ѳ (or <<f̀>>) & Ѵ (or /i/ or /v/)) that Ë is not a valid (is redundant) or useful grapheme and that in the <<civilscript>> it is easily replaceable with E (or <<ye>>) which in its context with other graphemes is producing the necessary pronunciations with the lanugage ultimately settling into 55 phonemes through the performance of 32 graphemes (the <<Congresses>> resulting in a cumulative loss of 15 phonemes and 13 graphemes), of all of these elisions the disappearance (or supression) of Ë is the most enduringly pernicious & devastating as for reasoning not in the codification of the refinements of the <<Congresses>> the usage of Ë in any typeset or longhand texts is punishable by official exilation at a minimum, trepidation over usage of Ë is promoting the blackmarket development of various mechanisms for <<yofication>> (the reintroduction of <<yo>>) for texts in various theaters, some digital applications are capable of presenting or supressing the presence of Ë depending on their viewing context, more insidious and advantageous to those stalwart yoficators is the development of a blunt technology for application to standard spectacle lenses analogous to the application of resistor pigmentations on motionsmoothing glassware, these particular spectacles are allowing for the presencing of the Ë in texts where its presence is absent, possession of such spectacles is a more egregiously intentional & conspiratorial (suggesting consciousness of wrongdoing) infringement of the administrations prohibitions against the usage of Ë, the presence of the Ë grapheme is enduring in language primers for children but disappearing as more flowlike reading skills are emerging adding the supression of nostalgia to the grievances of the population,
