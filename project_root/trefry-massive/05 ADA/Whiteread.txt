casting of the object is completely clandestine, insulation of duckdown and sago pith are lining the walls of the mould, municipal authorities are onsite with notice of the mould striking, the exposure, the great concrete omniform--just a squat inversion of spaces to inhabit, a stack of forbidden caves honeycombing together--<<Massive>> is a casting of high ADAmic technological and habitual traces surviving in the odd details of a fossil impression caught in its surface or the zigzags of a wooden staircase running up one of its walls or the reliquaries of data sockets, an apparitional building with no door no windows no walls no roof but the shape of the air, but the overall effect is the extremity of primitive simplicity, onlookers moving forward to touch its surface, the authorities are covering its surface with threadbare tarps just behind the crews striking the mould of bricks and mortar and windows and doors,

a house or a letter to the editor or a bespoke Harrington with vermillion lining or the honing of a great stone into a mutable omniform--any cultural object with living in its striding--is a tomb containing a stillbirth of ephemera that--becoming tangible--is surrendering its ephemeral tenancy, improvements to the structure into a situation--a status of occupation--beyond habitability, the eradication of human potential is progress,

<<Massive>> is a paradoxical concrete monument, the fleshfilling of negative space into something expulsive whose impenetrable within is retaining the sign of intimacy, a construction of absence, an incongruous object that is far from where its reposing is appropriate, being a dwelling in which occupation is impossible, a building whose space is without, a relic and a lode of aspirational fantasies about private life--what are secrets, what is honesty, what is joy, what is peace, where is home--a sculpture smooth with a deep sense of loss, it has the character of a tantalus full of ashlar, 

the <<Neighbor>> is taking emininent possession of a domestic building in isolation on the scrubby outskirts of <<the Estates>>--1926 through 1929 Grade Road--by means of his mycelial interweavings with the municipal authorities and emeritus designation within the nominally Daemone bureaucracy, timber foundation reinforcement is necessary for additional loading of the structure, stockpiling of internal miscellany--sinks, cupboards, rugs, partitions, lightfixtures, commodes--for alternative reintroduction to the housing stock, crews inside the building are filling holes in the walls and covering the windows with translucent paper in preparation and hiding within the mask of the structure are spraying the continuous internal surface with a debonding agent and a 5 cm outer veneer layer of granitic liquefaction in light grey with salmon pregnant with a catalyst and an interior 25 cm structuring layer of concrete with steel mesh reinforcement and leaving through a portal remaining in the roof and sealing the portal with a skimcoat of imitation granite over dense foam resting on a ledger, a separate crew is striking the external brick structure,

unlike other exemplars of monumental statuary--Durantes's climactic Minaret, Salty's pogonotrophic bronze head on a rosy granite plinth, the rosy granite sphere of Mary--mute with suggestion that their supplicants and secular pilgrims are valuable only for troth and fealty, <<Massive>> is stubbornly unheroic and democratic, the benevolent <<Neighbor>>--although communicating all specifications for the mould preparation and concrete mixture from within the vine swaddling of his culdesac ranchhouse in reproductions of documents bearing his debonair and aristocratic handwriting--is striving for a mutable and transcendent manifestation, vacillating between solitude and sociability, inherent in the separate but abutting cells of the extant mould of the derelict building on the outskirts of <<the Estates>>, the erasure of a daemonic apartment block's biography has been remade as an archaeological find, mutilation of domesticity in blank walls, blank windows are evoking the evil eye, an oddly simple vessel for the idle reflections and projections of passing or rubbernecking folks waiting on the corner for their transport or a few are checking in at the kiosk for ADA booster pamphlets,

the monument is a concrete veneer mouldcasting of the inside of an entire obsolete threestory protoADA masonry apartment massive--little resemblance is apparent to the public facade of an enduring identical massive occupying 1930 through 1933 Grade Road--a bald solidification of its intimate hollows is silencing the nudity of its secrets--the ground floor with four entry lobbies and piano nobile and attic story, including stairways and single vertex bay windows, but not the roof space behind the squat parapet, the late afternoon is mild with the sun baking <<Massive>> for the promotion of barometric respiration from its hermetic failures is reeking of the tomb of the filtering arachnohypens and tepid mushroom soup, distant barking dog, facing <<Massive>> from the other side of Grade Road is the severe masonry facade of the municipal Hall of Daemonic Youth, the children of stalwart ADA families are continuing to knock--in their inexorable cavassing rounds--on the thin concrete in doorframe protuberances--a distant stifling reverberation through the hollow body of the casting--at numbers 1926 and 1927 and 1928 and 1929 out of desperation for the repopulation of the <<Municipal Service>> or an inheritance of vestigial evangelism, the emptiness of rooms--where families stare out the windows with easy devotion to idle promises and deflections, the smell of tepid giblet and pickle soup and of walldrafts of moldspores--in the translation of phony megaliths heaping one on top of another, the photographic negatives of space, interior facing doorknobs are concave navels, architraves are incisions chiselingly latitudinal around the monument, foursquare sash windows are cruciform--Byzantine tapering resulting from easing away of the mould--extroversions, the emblematic features of nascent ADA construction are each vestigial architecturalizations of bespoke optimism, doors are mock tomb entrances to a giant sarcophagus, a mausoleum containing--but also concealing--the vain optimism of the ADAmic masses, echoes traveling hopelessly through the skies of Voronezh for a complicit surface,

rain is running and dirt sediment and mold and mildew are devouring the thin concrete, the opposite of human potential is the potential of weather,
