a photon is a location of incremental luminosity in the lighting solution & is not a trajectory, the sonic seasonings of a the whimper & the foliage of the planetree clacking & begging for mercy & the injurious rumor & the footfalls of a bird--only the shadow of the bird--through translucent plastic roof & the gale & the pulsation of granite--each are stationary in a notwavelike radiant shiver latently bristling the static medium, but sonority is a misconception as is luminosity, they are not properties of a greater scene but scenographic totalities in themselves, each grain is the whole,

isolation of a component or actor in relation to another component or actor is measurable--against the entire suite of factors imaginable--with distancelike gridcoordinates,

are masslike measurements feasible without the movement of a body against gravity, or from without is the comparison of two cellular matrices containing the same body feasible, is there a without or is without the blockmatrix also a blockmatrix, is there a suspension medium for the blockmatrix, the blockmatrix cannot exist singular nor can the neighborhood of blockmatrices be finite, 

construction of a vector between a node J & a node A in distinct blockmatrices is not feasible, nor is construction of a vector between a node J & a node A in a single blockmatrix feasible without the cooperative embodiment of all nodes along that vector,

peristalsis is the stillness of never swallowing, asymptotic satiation, 

the mechanics of dreaming are inseparable from the absence of luminous visual stimuli thus existing untetheringly from statuses of the world configuration thus incapable of existing as a still image, data neurochemical configurations is feasibly reviewable but only by a technician who themselves is not dreaming,

each iteration of echoing is an original utterance, 

the realization of a consciousness outside the solipsism of the viewer (or perceiver) is not possible in a unitalla framework such as this text, accepting the goals of this novel as successful is accepting the integration of self into the text or the disintegration of the text boundaries into the fabric of the perceptions,

you and I are ((coexisting in such a way as our sidereal configurations are identical) are communicating one as a reader & one as a writer) in oscillating concentricity,

the notions of apocryphal & ephemeral are nonexistent in the masonry of inescapable contemporaneity,

this textobject (nominally a <<booky>> or <<volume>>) is fully existent is coincident, visualizing this in the context of quotidian perception is an unreasonable venture requiring prophetic consciousness & portability of perception, construction of a text with the agenda of facilitating exhaustive visualization of its structuring & texturing is foolhardy, every booky is coincident, by disregarding the interior of every booky (by not reading it) the <<reader>> is manifesting its inherent coincidence and celebrating the dazzling flashingness of the textual potential, there are almost no pieces of writing that (upon closer inspection (reading)) are aligning with the expectations a reader is forming by looking at the volume as a solid rectangular cuboid,
