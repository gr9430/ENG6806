ikonrooms of the truly devotional--whichever chamber of the domecile is on the exterior frontage with the closest orientation to the Basilica--are in organization around a tabernacle for offering pebbles and other substitutive proxies of the Basilica--gravel is a numinous synecdoche of the platter--, the ADA's <<Cultural Analytics „Bureau of Elision“>> is coordinating the collection of tabernacles with triptych doors featuring the Daemon & Jsief Alpinist & Sergei Ktiya for official incineration exchangingly for corrective tabernacles featuring the Daemon & two depictions of Jsief Alpinist, possession of the tabernacles featuring Ktiya is illegal, a bizarre contraband reproduction of <<the Daemon Hodegetria>> gesturing to an infant Alpinist--rumors are abundant that the original in tempera on pressboard is in the Basilica icon room of Alpinist himself--, noteworthy ikon painter Andrew Rublaiv is leading the <<Daemonic Restoration Workshop>> under the auspices of the ADA's <<Cultural Analytics „Chief Administrator's Office“>> where otherwise unemployable artists are cleaning pigmentation of soot and candlewax vaporization accruing from the burning of devotional fragrances inside the Uspensky Basilichka in Dacula--<<Our Lady of the Basilica>> & <<Our Lady Orans>> & <<The Codification of the Daemon>> & <<Ct. Demetrius of Salonika>> & <<Our Lady of Svena>> & <<Our Lady of Tolga>>--all quintessential examples of the Vladimir-Suzdal School of easel painting with characteristic elongation of human proportions & satisfying indulgence in the brushstrokes skimming through pigmentation awash in copious linseed & luminously preternormal applications of cyanotic blues and alizarin reds, each distinct ikon is a concentration of administrative essence into a visual mythos upon which the pure disincarnate fixation of the devotional is activating a mysterious resonance--undetectable to the human ear or any readily available instrumentation--whose cumulative quivering is fluttering the atmosphere together into an oscillating airpressure phenomenon on the batterhead facade of the basilica is vibrating the resohead interior membrane of the nave into translatory machinery within the superstructure is powering the platter readhead armatures in the crypt, the performance of administrative calculations in the presence of the ikon is amplifying its resonance, cavities with thin copper jacketing on filamental baseisolation inside the ornate structural poche of the exterior wall are containing sensitive instruments for detection and translation of atmospheric disturbances into mechanical action utilizing the significant massiveness of the Basilica superstructure, calibrating for electromechanical impedance with nanopositioners controlling a probehead is tasting the vibrating airmass--the 3D nanopositioner in the Basilica probehead is the <<XYZ101 series nanopositioner>> by Attacube with a stacking composition of three individual elements, <<ANPz101>> is moving in the z direction & <<ANPy101>> is moving in the y direction & <ANPx101>> is moving in the x direction, with isolation gaskets on the basis of a theory relating the probehead cantilever frequency noise to the Brownian motion of its rigid body material composition, the probehead is in thermal connection to the probevacuumjacket with three fasciae of copperleaf--, a favorite ikon of secular Methodists is a reproduction of a painting depicting Alpinist crumplingly anguishingly gripping the bloodsoakingly lifeless body of the Daemon is gazing into the distance at a ceremonial mace on the floor with the tiny likeness of Ktiya is emerging from a vaginal brooch on the nightdress lapel of the corpse, such contraband reproductions on small commemorative chits are hanging beneath the clothing on devotional scapulars whose visibility is punishable with summary execution, <<The Violet Scapular of „Alpinist the Murderer“>>, <<The White Scapular of „the Most Achiral Duality“>>, <<The Rosy Scapular of „the Daemon's Living Heart“>>, <<The White Scapular of „the Annointment of Alpinist“>>, <<The Brown Scapular of „the Annointment of Alpinist“>>, <<The Gray Scapular of „the Ideal Visage“>>, <<The Gray Scapular of „Calculatory Devotion“>>, <<The Gray Scapular of „Sylvan Devotion“>>, <<The Red Scapular of „Kraanium“>>, <<The Gray Scapular of „Voronoic Devotion“>>, <<The Black Scapular of „the Slayer“>>, <<The Dark Brown Scapular of „the Most Infallible Extermination & Dismemberment“>>, <<The Olivine Scapular of „Cryptic Broadcasting“>>, <<The Violet Scapular of „Numerological Exorcism“>>, <<The Particolor Scapular of „Saint Michel Butor“>>, <<The Black Scapular of „the Administrative Grotesque“>>, the faithful mollusc is harboring no necessity of trepidation toward ikons depicting rank&file administrative figureheads such as <<Dale Sherman>> & <<Lisa Byrd>> & <<Robert Fay>> & <<Leslie Shepherd>> & <<Dennis Berhalter>>, reputable community alarmists are reporting that only ikons of the Daemon are surveillance devices--not technologically surveilling their quarry but via their resonance with social fabrics whose deformations around guilty consciences are easily recordable through deltas of communication between intimate partners resulting in amplification of devotional behavior, penitence is directly proportional to guilt--, all ikons featuring the Daemon--<<the „Great Gray Daemon of Sakhalin“>> & <<the „Sudarium of the Chara Sands“ Daemon>> & <<the Verblyuzhka Daemon>> & <<the „Kholodilnik Fata Morgana“ of the Daemon>> & <<The Daemon of Tsentergrad>> & <<The „Flawless Comptroller“ Daemon>> & <<The Daemon in Raiments of the Voronoi>>--are in possession of this sensitivity, the realization is affecting the faithful in all strata of the hierarchy throwing the cynically devotional into frenzies across the Adaemone, I am trangressing with admissions of doubtfulness about the mysteries of administrative faith but is it in my ikon room or out of vision of the ikons, liminexurban molluscs are pointing their ikons against the wallpaper during their devotions are garnering greater suspicion because of the silence accompanying the footage of their calculative offering, pigmentation bakingly chipproof on aluminum plating, genuflectingly looking into the deadgaze of the Daemon--although the ocular depictions are not the aperture through which the ADA is monitoring behaviors--is exacerbating urgency of penitence and increasing erratic & nervous behavior in & out of the radiating presence of the ikon in cyclically irrational anxiety that is amplifying even CSF solutions of the lowest guilt concentration, fearful lining of the ornate framings of the ikons with metallic foiling, mastic crumblingly and foiling is peeling from the framings of ikons, aluminum leaf on ikons, dipping the entire ikon into molten aluminum, acheiropoieton formations arising out of the cooling solidifying aluminum, the formation of tiny lenses in the ornate frame which are magnifying the brushstokes on seemingly innocuous areas of fabric drapery or meteorological phenomena in the background of the painting, celebratory tapestry--with a depiction of Alpinist eulogizing the Daemon--on a golden trapeze hanger, ikons are conventionally available with a protectively robing riza in gold repoussage of interlocking polygons--dodecagon & hexagon & square--each an ommatidium of the ikon compoundeye, modification of the riza masking an ikon--specifically those featuring the Daemon--is commonplace with relocation of apertures from the visage and sensory organ representations to more inconsequential areas of the ikon such as the landscape or the sky or the drapery of the raiments, the original apertures in a riza are erasingly pooling with aluminum from a small crucible and flooding their perimeters to a depth allowing sufficient overlapping of the new material for bondage with the original detailwork and a new application of thermal adhesive across the posterior, the resituation of apertures cutting into the patterning of the repoussage are resolutely straying from the initial location of apertures--conventionally the visage & handgesture & corona--into new compositions on the basis of distinguishing themselves from the generally anthropomorphic gentle ellipses & radii and elegantly delicate fingertip splayings are giving way to assertively alien geometries with reentrant vertices & arrays of numeralogically fiendish polygons, or in more affluent households the fabrication of a completely original riza for more precious ikons is commissionable from blackmarket goldmakers, the usage of a protective riza or <<oklad>> is so commonplace that many ikon paintings are developing the bizarre characteristic of rendering only the exposure of visage and handcurve are leaving blankness of gesso across the remainder of the pressboard, an apparitional floating headpiece is drifting away from the gently yet powerfully reposing amputation of the lefthand, these artistic decapitations are creating especially uninspiring outcomes--although promoting a cult of voidworship in some extremely remote voronoi--in their robings with riza modifications that are masking the disembodiment of the Daemon and highlighting only sallowing gesso,
