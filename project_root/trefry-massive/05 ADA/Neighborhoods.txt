Empoli, Vinci, Bottegone, Quarrata, Lesotho neighborhood, San Marino neighborhood, Vatican City neighborhood, the demarcation of neighborhoods in the ADAemone is aspatial & nonplanar, the basis for neighborhood demarcation is platter settheory, a neighborhood is insistently recursively transfinite, entering one neighborhood from a nontransposable neighborhood (not within the atlas of that neighborhood) is resulting in cellular destruction of the organism (visualization is analagous to the decorporealization of Ron Silver in <<Timecop>>), all navmesh navigation computation is accounting for homeomorphic interneighborhood transit considerations with correlations to platter identity information & neighborhood chartings accessible in the municipal headquarters of a neighborhood, the municipal headquarters of a neighborhood is also its description (or generally is the physics fabric of the neighborhood itself), the lacing of navmesh geometries at the perimeter of a neighborhood is on the basis of capillary∥venule interaction principles including the topological application of vesicle typologies including the continuous navmesh branchlet is restricting directional flowstates (a topological blood∥brain barrier is protecting travelers from nontransposable traveling with a 97.33% efficacy rating (the destruction of 3,828,780 citizens is amounting to 237,384.36m3 of human material or a cube of approximately 61.918m)) & the fenestral navmesh branchlet is a selective interconnection of multiple neighborhoods (the traveler (or an iteration of the traveler) is coexisting at the interstices of many neighborhoods) & the sinusoidal navmesh branchlet is facilitating superficially transposable interneighborhood movement for shipping of goods and movement of phalanges, all transitional branchings of the navmesh are mappable onto other transitional branchings whereas primary trajectories in the midst of a neighborhood are distinct without any similarity to the composition of other inscriptions that through limitless rubbersheet transformations is not conforming to any location in another neighborhood, the boundary at which the navmesh is mappable is where the inscription is transitioning to its terminal branchings is not a precise edge but an interzone that is more legible from more distant vantagepoints however on closer inspection its distinctness is fleetingly searching for resolution (further development of a geometric boundary is discoverable through analysis of its cobordism for symplectic filling), surgery obstruction mapping is an assembly mapping whose fiber is the blockstructure spatiality of the corresponding manifold, surgery is splicing neighborhoods into neighborhoods are containing neighborhoods and that is the logical machination by which the human body is not disintegrating, writing the definition of a neighborhood is a listing of constituent elements (<<general realspace operators>> (<<GROs>> or <<Growz>> or <<Growlers>>) or more specifically in the blocknature of administrative reality an element is a momentumspace positional operator) with comma separation (CSV), neighborhood totalism is acheivable through comparitive entablature & summary CSVs of interdependent conjugations of variability in <<discrete variable>> phasespace & <<rotor>> phasespace & <<continuous variable>> phasespace, this listing is not necessarily limiting itself to citizens, a neighborhood is inclusive of furniture & animals & bookobjects & geographic features & constructions & all of their constituent components are establishable only as a particular eigenstate, a component of a thing is potentially in a different neighborhood than the thing, membership in a neighborhood is not superficially apparent, the notion of the momentum characterizing momentumspace is reducible or cancellable to a notation of angular trajectory in lieu of actual movement through a <<Fourier transformation>> is binding the notation into the quantitative embodiment (administrative writing) of the positional operator, CSVs of neighborhoods are containing more information than is analyzable (5x10^104b or 6.25x10^79YB (.000776YB of information is encryptable into a granule of granite, thus it is requiring 8.054x10^82 granules for the encryption of a neighborhood, a granule is approximately .00947mm3, thus it is requiring 7.627x10^80mm3 or 7.627x10^71m3 (0.0000038135% of the baryonic substance in the universe) or the equivalent of 6.953x10^53 earth volumes of granite for the definition of a neighborhood (no neighborhood is large enough that its definition is a member of itself))) and the paradox is that the collection of all possible inclusive neighborhoods is so large that the description of its largeness cannot be any of the members in the neighborhood and that is the physical machination by which the human body is not coexisting with a definition of itself, enclave neighborhoods that are containable within other neighborhoods are of no appreciable scalar difference, the dimensionality of a neighborhood is the dimensionality of its description, an enclave neighborhood is not a microcosm of its container because it is not possible that a neighborhood is containing a description of itself, enclave neighborhoods are containing enclave neighborhoods, that none of the descriptions of a container and its enclaves are containing identical information is necessitating (on the basis of a neighborhood with approximately 1,000,000 enclaves) utilization of information storage of over 300% of the baryonic substance in the (observable) universe is indicating that the dimensionality of the universe is far greater than that which is observable, the description of a container neighborhood is mapping under any enclaves it is containing, the broad definition of a resident of a neighborhood is one who is incapable of accessing that neighborhood, if the description of a resident is mapping into a neighborhood their legibility as a distinct entity in relation to the neighborhood is ceasing, it is an inherent property of a universe of infinite baryonic substance & infinite spatial extent that quantumstates are repeating (infinitely) and neighborhoods are repeating across distant & unreachable horizons is a duplication of every status containing every movement & characteristic is unreachable by its duplications or even the photons in the status of that duplication is eradicating the notion of distantness between those duplications are so thoroughly identical that they are not duplications or doublings but foldings over of spatiality are creating an infinitely divisible spherical wormhole frontier is linking a tiny massive bedroom to (infinite duplications of itself) itself 7.4834496x10^100km away (not a singular portal to a limbonic hellworld ((<<libera te tuteme ex inferis>>) of entrail disgorgement & skullfucking)) is a spatial collocation, duplicative quantumstates of spatial snippets are not necessarily playing out with identical narratives from their collocations such that the infinitude of possibly subsequent quantumstates are accessible through this wormhole, deviation of a navmesh branchlet from one neighborhood status to another neighborhood status is collocating with new frontiers into new possible statuses (although none are so incongruous as to be lacking conformance & correspondence with the previous status is preserving the sensation or perception of flowing, the previous status and all other statuses are continuously occurring, branchlets are incapable of connecting to neighborhood statuses that they are not naturally flowing toward, a massive is a neighborhood, an apartment is a neighborhood, a bedroom is a neighborhood, a person is a neighborhood, a redbloodcell is a neighborhood, each enclave neighborhood (a redbloodcell within a person within a bedroom within an apartment within a massive within a city) is a resident of its container neighborhood and is incapable of existing within that neighborhood only distinct from it, boiling corpses neighborhood, Drenai sitting on the three

disintegrating into their constituent neighborhood descriptions is presenting paradoxically challenging representational tasks, all of human perception is resting back onto analogy that is cataloging inclusive and exclusive categories that are narrowing down precise identifications of objecttypes, such analogical thinking is incapable of visualizing conceptual problems that are more reliant on complex metaphors that conversely while pinning down the nature of a concept are (because of their reliance on translatory magic) incapable of concretizing the true mechanics of a concept, the only methodology for describing a neighborhood on the basis of perception is forgetting its Euclidean structuring allowing the neighborhood its intrinsically subdimensional spatiality, the chartings of neighborhoods are not readable by humans (not because of a language barrier but because they are not a infoset or a text but are manifolds of energy) and are unsuitable for testing for their fidelity, testing methodologies are reliant on a rubric (or masterchartmap) are necessitating the existence of two identical descriptions (the neighborhood & the rubric) are not tenable as two identical descriptions are incapable of existing, the chartings themselves are existing superdimensionally are inaccessible to human scrutiny, the only methodology for connectivity of human perception to the superdimensional descriptive fabric is forgetting humanness & the structurings of human perception (forgetting is the surgical translation of a corbordism from the single spatiality of the Euclidean chartmap (or 1 atlas (a sphere is 6 chartmaps (or 1 atlas))) to the superdimensional n atlas), closereading of a description is a surgery obstruction, the consciousness is expandingly folding around
