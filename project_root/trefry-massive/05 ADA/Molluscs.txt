the conventional bivalve mollusc is frightfully conscious of its stupidity, its inert uselessness, and its only recourse is to be poisonous, to slouch grumpily awaiting passersby to infect, for example in their discourse is the underlying tone that they do not believe their own contrarian positions, that their weapon is stupidity, no level of erudition or rationalizing can defeat willful stupidity, because knowledge is a knife and stupidity is a worm whose every part becomes a new entity,

the scalyfoot gastropod is a species of deepsea hydrothermalvent snail whose soft foot is armored with an imbrication of pyrite sclerites and shell with an unusually large relative heart size--4%--

the spadix is a mutation of four tentacles composing an erectile organ whose function is mysterious and lying in concealment in the oral region of the male nautilus, the nautilus is dying and sinking trailing the quadruped distension of its spadix through the watercolumn, 

this particular cephalopod--a relatively rare variant of mollusca--is drawing along limp hectocotyli searching for his lover, these mostly flacid arms are the refinement of an ideal form for the storage and transferral of spermatophores, it is mood and situation dependent but the options are to use the hectocotylus as a conduit for his spermatophores or he is wrenching it from his body--an act as ecstatic as death--and presenting it whole to her, she is recoiling from the gesture, the appendage is falling slowly to the floor,

the cephalopodic penis--the hectocotylus, a generic name from the supposition of classical philosophers who finding the appendage inseparable though incongruent in penetration of the female mantle it is bearing resemblance to a parasitic worm--is a muscular hydrostat with tissue fibers in an arrangement along the long axis and perpendicular--in alternation between vertical and horizontal--to the long axis as well as a series of hoops--in strata with oppositional chirality--around the long axis of the tentacle, all fibers are moving in concert with delicate motorization for intimate courtship,  

molluscan reproduction is reliant on the proper media for external fertilization, the gonads are a sheath--nominally the <<coelom>>, a small cavity that surrounds the heart--seeping gametes into the mantle cavity and gasping a dispersing cloud into the medium, from freefloating eggs are emerging trochophore larvae--dependent on their intelligence--factoring how much resource allocation is going to growing the brain rather than the body--more complex veliger larvae or even miniature adults are natal in the medium, 


into which they shed ova or sperm. The nephridia extract the gametes from the coelom and emit them into the mantle cavity. Molluscs that use such a system remain of one sex all their lives and rely on external fertilization. Some molluscs use internal fertilization and/or are hermaphrodites, functioning as both sexes; both of these methods require more complex reproductive systems.

a bird in its cage is breaking down its excessive beak against the internal shell of the cuttlefish and eating the calciumrich scrapings with a renewal of efficiency,

he is kneeling awaiting the erection of its head and pressing a fragment of cuttlebone to the tortoise's mouth, 

the pattern is geometrically hortulan--both inevitable and a contrivance--piling upon itself in the creation of a vision that is without completion or depth--for its substrate in the cuttlebone is far too shallow for the creation of actual depth and thickness even in the complex scrapings of multiliners and drypoint burnishers between expert fingers whose talent is noteworthy for conjuration of illusory thickets of movement from recognizably stagnant characters, 

the document, a forgery of an archaic prophecy about the Daemone, contains the ink of several thousand cuttlefish--the degradation of whose dusky sepia tones are far more believable as belonging to a distant totalitarian perspective--, 

his pupils in the shape of a <<W>> gazing upon a black hole in the shape of an <<X>>,

the cephalopodic female--gentleness of lovingly tender motherhood--is staying with her brood, a morsel of food coming into range is going directly in portions to the myriad tots, her miniature mate is sinking through the strata of the abysm, is staying with her vast brood even in the translucency of starvation as she is dying as predatory lingerers are devouring her and orphaning her offspring, 

the nervous system of this exemplary mollusk--unlike those around it whose pervasive networks are under the aegis of a sequestration of neurons in the protective darkness of skulls--is in a wide distribution of ganglions in its feet and knees and fingers and shoulders and spiralling around its esophagus,

although traitorous it is still a mollusk and the <<apparator>> is collecting all of the flopping on the floor dismemberment and squeegeeing the coursing fluids and burbling chum into an incinerator,

a cephalopod is suffering through cogstipation due to its kinship with the average mollusk--whose arching parabolic digestive track is ideally funneling nutrients and waste through the pinnacle of his conical mantle--though with a more globular gelatinous geometry unsuitable for the development of proper muscular sheathing or differential siphonal pressuring for cultivation of fecal motility beyond the keystone of its primary ganglion,

although compromising the integrity of its lorication and lying erotical in the valleys of its queasy flesh, hundreds of proportionally small eyes with protocornea and protolens in aragonite--selfsame in material to the lorica but of a larger crystalization for the enhancement of refraction and significantly thinner for the allowance of light transmission and analogous to the quality--though not appearance--of pearls--over a vacant chamber with a lamination of photoreceptive cells visualizing vague images of light and dark in the environment around the mollusk, only with enough clarity that it is recognizing the mosaical silhouette of a threatening presence, 

the folk of Belbeck are invisible pressing their faces to the hotel diningroom is vacant and silent apart from the gushing of electric fountains whose undulating luminance is wavering over the walls and large plateglass windows against the rising water and the slow and surreptitious wading insurgence of strange mollusk denizens glowing amidst the golden swaying of the eddies, with pressurization equal on the two sides are in protective restraint--the marvelous mollusks and the gloating onlookers of the outer dark--from ever interacting, 

a ribbon of teeth--the radula, a graduation in ferocity over the passive chymophagous filtering of certain other mollusks--is breaking down morsels of onionpickles with the musculature of an odontophore within the buccal cavity at the anterior of the creature is loping ahead of a mucustrail on its hirsute ventral foot through the dim forest floor, 

in the queue are tall men are slender willowy ladies are simple men in complex clothes are men with closeset eyes are men who are whispering into mustaches are women disappearing are men who are seeing their genitals only in the mirror are women who are loving them and supporting them and dying in silence are women whose undercrackers are grooving their flesh are great hairy couples and small collapsing stars are women with men's greatcoats and earhats are two children smaller than quadriceps are of common physiognomic characterization, are having a head, are having a foot and a visceral mass, are within the lorica of a mantle--a pallium--that is secreting its mucosal intermediary,

the mollusk is wild society's filtering device with capabilities for the removal of critical reasoning and synthetic approaches to practical problem solving by means of functional analogues and other contaminants, these creatures are also dependable for their fervency toward the presumptively indigenous ritualism of ADA practices and organizational guidelines and etiquette,
