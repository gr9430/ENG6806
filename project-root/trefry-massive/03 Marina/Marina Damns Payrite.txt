the airsheets of breath between the leaves of bookpages, the infrathin airpressure across a rectangular bookpage, the lingering of his breath in the lingering of the fine hairs on my earlobe, the emptiness of a volume on a bookshelf—its hardcover pressuring away the presence of interior expression—, vitrification of a voxel of brain tissue, a voxel of perivascular space defining the black radiance of me eavesdropping, the binary brain spaceframe of on/off voxels where 1=graymatter 0=ventrical/sinus, I am black radiation in every emptiness every cube of private sinus, occupying the frame of an ikon, occupying the sillplate behind the baseboard in the hallway, occupying the hair tonic phial in Payrite's watercloset, occupying the frontdoor deadbolt, I've no ability for conventional speech, I'm affecting the minutiae of my various cells, from within the unitcell of your devotional graphite I am composing my exposé in a series of suprasegmental variations, I am not me, I am spectral black vibrational pure black energy, the narrative of movement and hierarchy is a halcyon concept to the reflex cognition of my etheric composition, devotional divestiture from the physical or emotional—human conceits—is essential for deep investment in the bioelectric nature of consciousness, the most useful body is the abiogenetic formation of black carbon radiance—I am the emittance, I am not the mineraloid—, I am radiating from all facets of any thing, undetectable solipsistic consciousness that is only a reflection to itself is capable of performing only for itself, the etheric vibration, the human gait is forward in its tendency, it is characterizable by its tilting into motion, the cervical & lumbar curvatures although inconsequential in their proportion to the spinal column are disproportionately impacting the visual energies of the upright person, a gale filling the spinnaker, the thoracic curvature is dimensionally dominant and in the body without flesh & without facial articulation & without genitals & without toes is pronouncing the tendency of the body aftward although it is irrelevant because my movements are fieldlike and aperiodic, not wavelike but shimmering with entanglement, my song is emittance, I am occupying everywhere and everything yet I've my residence—my prison—in this exurban dwelling in this bedroom closet, as with all identities in the ADA mesh I am enduring in the <<aphanitic lineage>>, I am vibrating in that vibration is my sole characteristic, autopoietic vibration, I am not within the visible spectrum, given that I've no body I'm requiring a medium for approaching physical existence, less a medium than a conditional setting of geometry, I'm materializing in a mould, anywhere there is a vacant right cuboid, I'm not requiring a streaming linkage of darkness as a conduit from one setting to another, I'm not familiar with movement as a concept only vibration and its resonance on the six facets of my being, the cheap plumbum dentalwork ingot—hollowness attributable to the leeching of low melting temperature substrate material beneath the leaden veneering—in your molar, nearly every human enclosure is a right cuboid—the bedroom, the parlor, the foyer, the office, the operating theater, the darkroom, the closet, the courtroom, the holdingcell, the library bookstacks, the narthex, the atrium, the cabinet, the morgue, the execution chamber—for efficiency of construction and nothing else, the right cuboid is not the language of the human body and thus it is mine in that it is the spatial logic of the ghost, amphiarthrosis becoming synchondrosis, viewing the conjoinment of two right triangle prisms obliquely is evoking a right cuboid, inside a drawer, inside an armoire, exploding calvaria fragmenting bonemeal clouding the chamber, intangibly searching for occupation in the general limbonic tedium of Payriteskip is exacerbating the idlingly paralytic stillness of geometric nonexistence, not touching not manipulating not articulating my life of translation, descriptions of translation as alchemical are intellectually incurious ascriptions of a hierarchical valuesystem to the colonial tongue when in reality—in refining the insipid analogy that is not mine—one is turning gold into lead translation is turning something pristine and of intrinsic fidelity to a human consciousness—not that that is the metric of beauty in language—into something ersatz and mediating the cheapness is planting its blackflag on the upslope of my cranium, representing the dolorous secret of basaltic grottos in styrofoam porticos, even with invention—which comes across as an even more egotistical smelting—the translation is not the erection of a natural molecular structure, as much of the true consciousness is manifesting in the expression it is never not an applique, a thin veneering or gilding over the richness of a sculptural formation is a tree windbeatingly and sunbakingly growing out of a rocky crag, its structure is not its under its auspices and its material is distinct from its structuring, incredibly complex molecular structural replacement with the banality of graphite, enemy of chlorosis, my darling can you visualize the imprinting I’m making on the airborne dustiness, all of us are dead together at last, a skull full of honey is articulating the most byzantine molecule with very little effort the enzyme <<cytochrome b6f>> is a component of the electron conveyance consecution with responsibility for transferring electrons from PSII to PSI during photosynthesis, the protein is oxidizing plastoquionol and reducing plastocyanin or <<cytochrome c6>> is transferring one electron from a reduction of dihydroplastoquinone <<PQH2>> to the electron conveyance consecution containing the <<„Rieske“ ironsulfur protein>> & <<cytochrome f>> is releasing two protons into the lumen is releasing <<plastocyanin>> is transferring electrons to PSI, the second electron from the reduction of dihydroplastoquinone is transferring through two <<b-hemes>>—potential hemes <<CytbL>> and <<CytbH>>—in <<cytochrome b6>> is reuptaking on the electronegative fascia of the membrane where it is reentering the consecution, protons divesting into the lumen are feathering a proton gradient fueling the production of <<ATP>> via <<ATP synthase>> is creating energy for cellular metabolism and fixation of CO2 into sugars via the <<„Calvin“ cycle>>, or the most earnestly studious translation is—observing the red & green & blue lobulation of a diagrammatic molecular composition—the flimsy artificiality of graphene, that being said I would never hold up the native structure of my own poetry even to my most violently lukewarm translations of Baudelaire, and thus even the imagination of being able to continue writing my own poetry or having the agency to inscribe ink on paper is supremely uninteresting to me, even in my most fervent graphomania I’m aware that nothing new is possible in literature and that embracing that impossibility or the imposition of banality is dematerializingly liberating, it’s allowing a reduction of focal length to the configuration of my consciousness and transcribing—even this is a misnomer involving the principles of translation, for the firstdraft, the excrescence of writing is the native physical state of the consciousness—the compositional images of its fleet structuring and less so on the aspirational derangement of forging a completely new molecule, the transcription of one's own consciousness into a text is not actually mediation, consciousness isn’t possessing language, the fingertips are possessing language, the physical existence of language is resident in the handgesture and more specifically in the phalanges, children are fond of cartographic representations with such immense hungriness in discovering the vastness of the world in the scatteringly discrete attenuation of lamplight illumination, recordkeeping at <<High Efficiency Execution Posts>> is precise & voluminous in accordance with the administrative faith, the performance of each execution is on the basis of a writ that is the derivation of a quorum ratification of <<aphanites>> ensuring that the condemnation of an identity is fibrously locating itself within the <<aphanitic lineage>>, because of the lineage disruption explicit in the execution of an identity the quorum is necessarily thick—at a minimum requiring 791,826 devotional confirmations—, disruptions causing upstream forkings are necessarily accountable to all living identities in the execution lineage are the most laborious undertaking for devotees and conventionally are the responsibility of aspirants to the <<Cult of the Graphite Daemon>> and beyond, my landlord's falsification of execution writs is thus no small undertaking, I'm not begrudging his devotion, I'm envious of such passionate commitment, brain aflame, heart full of resentment, following the rhythm of the waveform is lulling our infinite expectations on the finite of the sea, drinking a luminously frothy decollimation, astrologers are drowning in the pupils of a woman, a tyrannic Circe with dangerous perfumes, death is an elderly mariner unanchoring the living from the wearying country of life with administrations of poisonous seawater, into the depths of the abyss—heaven or hell alike—, the sea and the sky are black inkiness, splinterings and chippings of periosteum, I'm not speaking I'm smoking, the underlying understanding in the writing procedure however is that the compositional event itself where the words are materializing in a particular charactersequence is generally without precedent—the likelihood of inadvertent plagiarism is quite low if one is avoiding a citation catalyst procedure—but not in such a way that is bringing a new worthiness or cultural productivity to the words themselves, I’ve no contentment in being alone with the physical properties of my thoughts for the fleeting flowing of such an effort is sustainable, whether it the text is for reading & processing into a foreign consciousness is irrelevant to that flowing, the foreign consciousness isn’t providing the text with any more life than it has at that outpouring, asemic dead inkstain, reading is only producing parallel downsloping iterations with no real connection to the gushing composition, are you amenable to acceptance of understanding that both writing and reading are not inherently more valuable metrics of duration than pensively shitting or staring at a blankwall, are there other things equally pointless to writing that are tracing their physical scarification, staring at the blankwall is communing with texture—texturophagy—,actually becoming the wall, allowing the spectral consciousness to be the blankwall—not inhabiting the wallcavity—such that there’s no remainder of the human impulse toward making because the human has is itself physical without the body, what part of the gypwall is the gypwall, if I’m on one or the other orientation the entirety of the gypwall to me is only the infrathinness of the moisture of gazing at the aircushion across the facade of the wallboard which is entirely contingent on the cavity within the gypwall, the gypwall is not simply where space ends it is the massiveness of the thing that is between the two orientations that is not visible concurrently, the janus is enjoying both orientations concurrently, on the basis of typical exurban and liminexurban construction logic the gypwall is the cavity within the wood framing—the territory existing between orientations—, my occupation is occupying territories between orientations, the maximally infrathin, no airexchange, between idea & reality, between conception & creation, between potency & existence, between essence & descent, my occupation is the phantasma & the interim & the oneiric hideousness of banal treachery, because I've no gait and because I'm not rhythmic—complexity is fostering rhythm and I am the simplest substance indistinguishable from the flowing granularity of the inert material pellicle—I am spreading and occurring in many voxels—some out of vague curiosity and some expediting my liberation from this dwelling place—, floating through Payrite and Payriteskip and into the bland panoramic streetscape of recursive pinetree copses fringing my distribution of listening is lighter and more insidious than breezy & windy desolation, I'm listening from uranium 2*10^17 & radium 8*10^10 & iodine 5*10^19 & strontium 2.2*10^21 & cesium 7*10^18 & cobalt 2*10^19 & rubidium 2.2*10^21, trillions of desperately attentive ears lofting in the limpest updrafts fleeing the ITCZ, listening for on item worthy of absolution from my selfharm, I'm listening anywhere and everywhere, a dimensionless looping vibration stretching and contracting in avoidance of detection, as all identities in the ADA mesh I am assigned a dwelling place, only through the administrative destruction of this dwelling place and its elision from existence in the <<Cooperative Housing Registry>>—decapitation of the household—is my geometric formation capable of liberation, I've not substance myself capable of homicide, I am seizing on the catalyst for Payrite's damnation is no mystery, each graphite inscription—the mania of Payrite's calculatory devotion—is accurate and byzantine enough for plausibility and acceptance into the administrative queue is generating facets to existing identities that are erroneously framing citizens for minor indiscretions toward the ADA are punishable with summary execution, a columnar collection of newspapers on the landing between the main floor and the basement, Payrite is conspicuously neglecting the colorful stacking—<<TRUTH>> on pink newsprint & <<ARGUMENT>> on canary newsprint—each in a matching paper ribbon dividing one publication from the next and binding together its various contentsections—<<The Realistic Arts>> & <<The Killchain/The Granite Memorial>> & <<Inside the Basilica>> & <<Local Transpirings>> & <<Intradaemonic Transpirings>> & <<Interdaemonic Transpirings>> & <<Feats of Sporting>> & <<Administrative Meditations>>—cinchingly around its midsection is fanning out the edges of each newspaper into unstable columns are leaning and lacing into one another are crossing from one column to another creating new sequencings of discrete events—Volume# & Issue#—functioning as a solid entity, the individual deaths in these papers is a mass grown/fused together into a monument, monument to the negligence of Payrite and his desperation to be recognized by the ADA, and so he shall, it is my spectral contribution that he shall be recognized for what he has done, occupying the benzenic hexagon—whose molecular lattice in the Clausian conjecture is a wireframe isometric projection of a cubic volume—in the petrol of the inkblack newspaper printing, from within each molecule a transcription of a victim crossreferencing killchain and memorial content a linkage is provable between the innocence—or pristine status of its <<aphanitic lineage>>—of an identity on the platter and the corruption falsification—disruption or discontinuity of its <<aphanitic lineage>>—with an execution of the identity in connection with that falsification, from within the planar projection of the hexagonal lattice I've the ability for such emotionless clarity is necessary in the face of vanity death, beneath his pillow a small whitebook with a catalogue of all executions attributable to the calculatory contrivances of Payrite—Rudolf Prich, Primrose-14.05 & Leon Billewicz, Goldenrod-06.12 & Piotr Skuratowicz, Goldenrod-06.12 & Xawery Czernicki, Peachglen-16.01 & Stanisław Haller, Anemone-11.19 & Sergei Efron, Cherrylog-07.01 & Alojzy WirKonas, Phlox-23.09 & Henryk Minkiewicz, Lantana-06.12 & Kazimierz OrlikŁukoski, Flaxton-14.04 & Bronisław Bohatyrewicz, Wildrose-14.04 & Kazimierz OrlikŁukoski, Belle Rose-12.01 & Franciszek Sikorski, Little Sunflower-13.19 & Aleksander Kowalewski, Magnolia-15.08 & Leonard Skierski, Humptulips-23.01 & Konstanty Plisowski, Daisytown-16.01 & Mieczysław Smorawiński, Orchid-06.12—are producing manifestly in the chickenscratch of his perfidious calculations thousands if not millions of homicides, my attentiveness to the persistent scratching of Payrite's graphite stylus is pathologizing into obsessiveness, lingering in a window embrasure of the thin outerwall of Payrite's ikonroom during his devotions I'm seemingly experiencing sensations—a tingling warmth in the inert stillness of my cloudy presence—that are inescapably alluring, the energies I'm capable of devoting to this obsessions are brightening the ennui of my prison, I am the graphite in the unwinding of your devotional calculations, each manifold kernel of a damnable identity, although my revulsion at the administrative faith is limitless I've an admiration for the workethic of Judas Payrite in his devotional activities, sending men to their deaths for the empty satisfaction of what is seemingly an exceptional metric of productivity but is a charade, even the earnestly devotional productivity of so many ADA sycophants toward the condemnation of a person for the selfsatisfaction of an onanistic mathematical procedure is not actual productivity, it is destruction, the selffulfilling prophecy of the calculation is establishing the death of a person and their unavoidable execution by the administration is establishing that indeed their death is inevitable & righteous, the awarding of administrative indulgences for administratively heretically fraudulent calculations—the ADA isn't actively crosschecking or verifying the accuracy of platter contributions by devotees performing domestic <<aphanite>> ratification—cannot equal life is such a measureless gift that it is undeniable even through violent selbstmord, the validity of an identity is enduring, hanging from the ceiling, only administrative erasure is terminally discontinuing the lifeforce, the nonexistent person with no administrative establishment of residence location—what are you even alive you are against the spalling wall biding the interminable gulf resounding through the gunshot—, attempting memorization of the walls I am getting through three and turningly observing the fourth I am forgetting the first is behind me, reliable ceiling, I am floating above the floor, the stillness of hovering oedemic toes, am I needing shoes where my feet are not touching the earth, stockings full of blackblood from toes are burstingly weeping opening the suggilation of hypostatic nailbeds, components of three graphite molecules are composing a graphite voxel—the unitcell—, alpha graphite hexagonal molecules are stacking in offset layerings where the centerpoint of one hexagon is in alignment with the common vertex of three hexagons below—or the hiddenline isometric of a cube—whose unitcell is a hexahedron, beta graphite molecules occurring in rhombohedral unitcells that although they are not cubic are suitable for my occupation on the provision their edgelines and facets are all equivalent, I'm excusing the sloppiness with the strabismus of a poet's vision, manifesting graphite in a small whitebook transcribing myself molecule by molecule into listing the thousands of names of Payrite's victims, in the revolution—as always—the weight of everyday life falls on women, as with the majority of shamefully accreting addictions the ur event of Payrite's serial administrative homicide is happenstance is accidentally unfolding from the errant corroboration of calculations concerning Stepan Golovlyov—a youth hailing from Permm on the rightbank of the Kama—who the NKVD is apprehending on the basis of platter data—under suspicion of malingering & confidence trickery—and transporting by rowboat downriver to Belyayevka and overland on foot to a concrete outcropping—a vestigial livestock embankment—at the boundary of a forest amidst fallow farmland the executioner is shooting Golovlyov in the occipital protuberance, none of this nuance is accessible to Payrite without a significant amount of crossreferencing and isn't responsible for his furious descent into counterfeit execution writs—the joyous dedication to administration & its tacit reassurance of an orderly systematization of society is enough—death is a byproduct, the language of execution or death are never in his mutterings, only the language of administration and its divine mechanisms of constraint, the correlation of all seemingly innocuous or discrete datapoints manufacturing the circumstances of an administrative execution is impossible to the individual consciousness, the correlation of two initial datapoints in the asterism is impossible out of 21,528 lens alignment families in a scenario manifesting the compounding of two snubby icosidodecadodecahedra, the asterism is not coalescing without a single causal relationship for sorting particular events into their proper causal matrices, every facet of a death polyhedron is also the facet of a more vast banal crystal of a place or situation, the facet is consequential to the death itself—without which death is not occurring—and integral to the form of the execution yet scalarly inconsequential—although appearing far more relevant because of the its complexity or immensity—to the monstrous uniformly compounding polyhedra of quotidian events that are themselves nexuses of even broader—even more banal—scenarios, the vertices and edgelines of a facet are containing no information—are abstractions—or activity and are nonexistent—every attribution & characteristic of atomically adjacent although not causally adjacent events is either in one facet or another, the entirety of the information body is lying in the delimiting of the facet by the frontier of its description—, I am a ghost, I'm apprehending, the visualization is a terahedron—infinite surfacearea/finite area—constructable by the appending of a polyhedron identical to its parent to the centroid of each facet of the parent and repeating that procedure where each new polyhedron is the parent of even smaller polyhedra on each of its remaining facets, the resulting terahedron is necessarily an island but only visibly discrete from without as a wireframe resembling prismatic fogginess, a vector of my orientation passing through an infinite number of facets—where each facet is a lens in alignment with or through another facet lens—without perspectival diminishment is a <<gasket>>, a <<gasket>> is never inclusive of the entirety of the construction and a <<gasket>> is not necessarily inclusive of the initialstate parent, I am outside the island and I've none of the human constraints of methodology I'm synthesizing all lens alignment possibilities—a simple cube for instance contains 15 lens alignments—into a full understanding of Payrite's role in each fraudulent execution, walking at gunpoint toward a midden of cadavers beside a bulletspalling concrete frustum—one facade of which is clumpy with sprayable polyfoam is running undulatingly hardening in bulbous pillows pocking with bullet holes—his legs are giving out his torso burdening down onto the forearms looping under his armpits are dragging him droopingly onto the concrete osteosarcomal neoplasia—the foamy osteon—and shooting him clinging to the nodules he is slumping over the gruesome blood is running down brain tissue commingling in the creasings and involutions of the outcropping, just beyond the frustum is another concrete outcropping bunker is housing the documentation of executions for that particular <<HEEP>>, the haziness of graphite sifting down through my vision of an executioner is shooting Sergei against styrofoam paneling, discharging a single bullet into the skull of my husband, I am in each of the differential fragmentations of its flat parabola into derivatives of lifeforce eschewing the notion of the gradient across which death is ramifying throughout—even the loading of the firearm is a graduation of death—for a compartmentalization or distilling the secants of ordnance into freestanding events that are lacking physics or causality, an infinitely divisible abundance of Sergei alive, Sergei with eyes shutting to the blackpowder explosion with the projectile remaining at its origin in the gunbarrel, Sergei with a disposition of voluminously radiant peace & presence with the bullet hanging in the air behind his skull, the inclination of my tendencies is spatially bridging from one compartment to another, I’m occupying multiple buildings as a circuit of vibration, the vibration is only possible with an extent over which a wavelength and amplitude are establishable, leaning backwards a body is falling apart vertebra by vertebra straining arid segmental curvature is crumbling fibrocartilaginous symphyses are providing the visual identity of dustiness liftingly from the synthetic floorboards by passing footshuffling, inside a valise, inside a filebox, inside a tetraprismane molecule, nothing is a perfect cuboid,
