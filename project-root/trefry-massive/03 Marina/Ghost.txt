my ghost is wearing a fur coat, the ability for or the ability for recognition of selftouch is elusive, I am reminding myself of things impossible without autotangibility, crossing my legs, chewing or gritting my teeth, peristalsis, anal tone, a fist, snapping fingers, slipping my fingers recognizably between my legs, crossing my arms over my breasts, my breasts resting against my ribs, heart valves, eyelids cloaking and moistening my eyeballs, scratching my head--rather than the tip of my finger encountering a flea in my hair and pushing it throughout the void of space--, my fingernails resting in their nailbeds, this is not simply a concern over tactility but over autotangibility in general, am I touching inanimate things, is this how clothes are remaining on my body, is this how I am lying on the floor and not falling through the floor and I do not stop falling, I am touching the corpse emaciation of Ayla, I am touching her face with my three middle fingertips, am in possession of the capacity for injury, is the firing of a bullet injurious to me, is the stabbing or slashing of a blade injurious to me, is the collision of an auto with my body a possibility, climbing the stairs of a tower, the stool is toppling the noose is passing through my neck, floating is impossible, in fact I've the belief that gravity is impacting me more significantly, the mode of arbitrariness is an impossibility in my performance, I cannot, my meekness isn't an affectation it is an acquiescence to the programmatic organization of my death existence, I am a ghost, I've awareness of this, I'm not solid, I've provisional attributions for physical touching and I'm touching but the other gripping or the other thigh or crook of the arm are only abutting--not with the warmth of electric repellence that is sensory comprehension of tactility--the spaciousness of my particle system against the cold bottomless dovetail of an other molecular spaciousness--more bewilderingly the tendency is of real flesh breaking through the barrier into oblivious coexistence with the nominal establishment of my flesh--, what is it that is tensile in touching, what is that rubber apron then if not the strength of vibration in transmission of repellence to another vibrating entity, it is the hesitation of a patternlanguage specific to one particle system, the dissonance of those patternings is touching, the patterns are not merging without falling apart, the patterns aren't falling apart if they have no being that is the establishment of their patternlanguage, only other ghosts with the recognition of tselbstmordzy in an other are capable of intertactility, we are relishing this parallel dullness together, the discontinuity of my mother's touch, not her discontinuing the touch, but my ceasing of its registration, I am observing the human form in contact with things, my mother's fingers on piano keys, Alya is lying in a tiny gray bed without falling through it and without the bed falling through the floor, the tree trunks are thinning in a brief gradient that is opening fully to the sky and the rising terrain is folding over onto a wide grassy savannah, lying down in the tall grass I've the sensation of exploratory caressing, deerticks beneath my clothes scanning my body and describing it with their pathways, the distant telegraphy of bison hoofsteps and the stacatto romping of their frisky calves, myself and the plasterboard of my closet whose salt ghosts of lake water & sea water, precipitation across tabular membranes in the depths of hotsprings, the salt ghosts of volcanic vapor soot encrusting & intravenous sulfate solutions resonating especial spectral physicality beneath the kraftpaper is embracing with tightly ensconcing arms around me crouching on the floor leaning backward with my feet against the door--the ghost of trees and their nutrition from the regolith--my knees splaying to the flanking walls, this entity who is holding me close to its inert orthorhombic heart, I've the sensation of swaddling in especially dampproof walls in pale lavender plasterboard of angelite, tripestone--vulpinite--plasterboard, celestine plasterboard, I've the sensation of sitting on the large wood meetinghouse bench propping up my figure in its in its skeletal xylemic spindliness, Ayla--my daughter--her head is resting in my smock catenary between my thighs is sinking into the threadbare softness of dark gray flannel--I've the awareness of the almost unabatingly imperceptible sinking into the fleshnest, the appearance of nestling is not ceasing--such that I am allowing her body rolling from me onto the bench in avoidance of her fully passing through my body, a straggling framing nailhead standing out from the bannister is dragging against the clothing--not tearing it--is drawing blood on the skin beneath--or so I've the observation of clothing being a communicative membrane, is the starchiness of the smock structural enough for supporting Ayla in the absence of my physical coherence, and because I am noncommutative the sensation of touching me is allowable but I've no sensation of touching her only vision, if my retinas are receiving light information light is a corpse then, Ayla is sleeping beside me in the bench, dark gray plainweave flannel across my thighs with the absent softness of napping spaciously gauzing the warp and weft into equal divisions over the emitter surface of my thigh, my flesh extrusion through the lattice in flaccidly hypostyle strands extruding--not toward an attractor but with the simple reactiveness of gravitational and frictional willynilly--without a <<cutter>> threshold the flaccid flesh hair trajectories are diffusing into the room, the ductile flesh scalar is filamentary in proportion to where I am the quaternion--not more slender relationally but more slender in ratio, of a consistent girth--whose determination of flesh vectors is eradicating the physical coherence of the emitter surface into the foaminess of my atmosphere--the gossamer thicket of hyphae is filling the room--in severance each strand is offgassing its conidia coalescing into the chitinous beak of a daemonomorph, Ayla is aspirating the web of strands is anastomotising new feltings of catalytically tselbstmordzy muscle tissue in her living flesh, is my desirousness of touching her so selfish, the tselbstmorderin is the only possible ghostliness of a human and only ghostly within the maintenance of her nominal vitality--only the awareness of the emptiness of death within life is the vraiment alive deathconsciousness, death ghosts are impossible because they are not in possession of lifeconsciousness--through togging of repellent vital dullness--a mutable molecular lattice reacting to the material of true vitality--around itself allowing it nominal life within persistent death, the free rubble of molecular energy beneath is recognizable only to other ghosts or ghostly perceptions, the tselbstmorder is differing, a man is measuring information from the platter is heaping the layers of compulsion upon him with inescapability in the perception of a series of omens and entrapments of interminable failure or obstruction, I'm declaring this but it isn't for the diminishment of their passage, it is a qualitatively different passage with the same destination, so the tselbstmorder is not in possession of the ghostly capability, at least of the ghostly physicality, although he is in possession of the ghostly perception, the tselbstmorerin is--in the materiality of her initial consciousness--consciously dead and with physically deathlike vitality, she herself in the womb is of this seemingly impossible mutability of material lattice and she is falling out into the cold glaring, falling and falling and falling seeping through my womb into the coldness, I'm spinning this tale for her--it's the midst of <<Maslenitsa>>, Ayla's birth is incredibly easy, you are healthy & beautiful & pink, I'm demanding a large meal in my hospital nook and annoying all of the other women convalescing in the obstetric recovery hall with <<I've a daughter, I've a daughter>> and my voraciousness and eating loudly clinking my utensils, the unavailability of meat is a constraint of the holiday, instead a tumbler of tepid stewler & a round platter with three strata each of eight radiating blini--each an octavo eighth of a circle eight layers thick from three symmetrical foldings--with a clod of cream and butter at its vertex melting and wicking through the spongy layers--I've full awareness of Ayla's adoration for the story, it is a route for her imagination into darkness and warmth in the mass consciousness of motherness, as most narratives are mechanizations of trajectories into mother or into the soil--burning corpses is expensive--the tale is necessarily simplistic and lacking but it is a falsification, although her birth is truly serene and effortless it is not so in the manner that I am relating it to her, everything in association with my motherhood is a misnomer yet I am her mother, we are occupying the same space, I am an obstetric statue in a classroom whose torso and organs are fabrications of translucent acrylic in reassuringly vital visceral hues--all variations of brown are earth of Umbria & blood red & eschar & nutmeg & fawn & blood red & chestnuts in a newsprint cone & vanadinite & chickadee down & maroon & shearing wool is staining with the carmine of lamb's blood & translucent taupe & coelom in shadowy umbrage of mesothelium--around an opaque girl standing in shabby loafers and a fawn sarafan, it's probable Ayla is climbing the curving staircase between the double shell musculature of my uterus--through the excision of archways in lateral fibrousness of circular junctional tissue looping around her little home cavity--standing atop the fundus dome screaming for assistance but I've awareness of the absence of material for her engagement--although its contourings are legible--I've awareness of her feet lifting away from the dome toward the ceiling of our attic room, she's simply osmosing from the status of inside the threshold to outside the threshold, the warm hue of the burning <<Kostroma>> effigy in the street below is making the room feel colder, and I am more frigid, Ayla is lying screaming red on the hard bed cold sweating in our garret apartment in lieu of my laborious suspension just across or above the bed and reaching out to touch her and pull her to me I am feeling the cold sweat evaporating but not her skin, she is lying in the pram or the bassinet or Sergei's arms, through an inscrutable sequence of physical repercussions I'm effecting Alya's location--moving her from the pram to the blanket in the sunlight or tying a scarf around her waist in the rocker for meals--, the passing through, the being within, it's imagery is erotic and lovingly delectable, it is the coldest most empty status of corporeality, and I've the attitude that this capability is unreasonable on the basis of my etheric ilk of physics, it's not an occupation of much fretting for me, I've acceptance that she and I are alone in a room together & she is an immobile infant & she is in one location & she is in another location, I only know that even my imagination is incapable of describing the sensation of my skin touching her skin, or the meatus constriction of Sergei's--or any of them for example--ovuliparous ejaculation expanding gas gouts of fibrous mistiness into a description of my formal volume, although I'm aware of the necessity of these capabilities for various reasons I've no certainty about their execution by me, where there is the potentiality of materiality where I've recognition of formal endurance beneath my flannel smock it is of no enduring pattern such that my reaching for touching is adopting the pattern of the opposing body and passing through the tensors of its molecular asterism, the appearance of my fingertips within the mass of the opposing body crescently distending floaters in antumbral foaminess, ears are hiding in fur hats, I am speaking French to Payrite, it is the erection of a boundary across which the pattern with the inability of crossing but flowing around my caressing Alya's cold face my touching the corpse face, I am reachingly near my daughter's skin with novel curiosity, am I able to touch her corpse, even this--the most joyous and poignant realization of a corpsession with my daughter--is only a not so easily accessible activity of the imagination, the starvation of her little pale body and the cruelty of its defrauding her tender brain of urgency is--even this is an activity of the imagination--lying under the one threadbare sheet transitionally in dedication to the presentation of all corpses--a sheet adequately robust for sleeping is finding its best usage for sleeping not death, bedclothes are not baggage for purgation--on a cot in the children's <<massive>>, the only true possession of a piece of furniture is in a properly defensible location adjacent to a wall where maintenance of referencefeatures and political boundaries of the greater immovable construction are abiding, the catafalque of her cot is in the middle of a room, what is the compulsion toward ownership in a corpse, that I am touching her skin is assurance that the impulse of respiration is absent from her body,
