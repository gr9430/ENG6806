my condemnation my exilation is interminable, the jaunt on foot to the Sannikov municipal center is prohibitively distant and full of navigatory complication--curiously on a citymap the citycenter is less than 2km away overland however it is over 30km via the most efficient navigable roadroute--is necessitating walking in darkness on both legs of the voyage is necessitating leaving Nadia and Anna alone at Payriteskip or bringing them both with me is necessitating leaving the pig alone at Payriteskip, in lieu of productive outings to my casemanager at the municipal center we--myself & Nadia & Anna & the pig--are wandering the involutions of Hinckley Estates passively easily losing our bearings in the repetition of housing typologies are improvisations on the splitranch whose primary variable is the location of the frontdoor in relation to the four windows of the housefront--1 window in the mastersuite & 2 windows in the parlor & 1 window in the outboard bedroom--although none of the variations has windows on either sideface, it is useless to attempt cartography or establish landmarks in the repetition--one residence is cleft horizontally across approximately 1/3 of its facade through which at a precise alignment daylight is visible in a striking enough oddity that the house is remarkable however it the existence of one landmark is not fruitful without a causalchain of other landmarks for relative navigation--, we are discovering the gateway to Hinckley Estates where an arteriole roadway is quietly bleaching its ashpalt in the hazy daylight the erosion of auto tyres softly affecting the murmur of intermittently passing autoconcretetransports on the otherwise silent panorama, across the arteriole is dense forestation of 5m tall Heracleum mantegazzianum & Heracleum sosnowskyi is listing in the vehicular slipstream, no construction or development is visible beyond the edge of the subdivision, on either side of the T intersection is a small unoccupiable post&beam pergola with lettering--<<HinckleY>> on our right & <<EstateS>> on our left--scrollcutting blackletter from thin plywood is delaminating and curling into threedimensional serifs of disrepair, the pig is rooting and nuzzling a snout of red clay daubingly around pinestraw at the edge of a copse of interlacing pinetree limbs are fingeringly foregrounding fascicles is massaging slender apertures of background opening & closing in the hesitant breeziness with a careful scanning surveyal if the concrete efflorescence hue variation of a <<massive>> facade behind the trees, the vestige or architectural metastasization of the ADA this far into the liminexurbs is startling, not that Sannikov is a refuge lullingly whisping away the horrors of administration--Payrite's indefatigable devotion are memorial enough--yet my impulse is running into the roadway with submission into the grille of an autotruck is a snubsquare tiling lattice shredding me into a senseless remorseless fearless formless mistcloud of squareshapes & equilateral triangles is drifting on the vehicular slipstream through the pineforest bloodfog and fleshrain condensing and pooling at the concrete apron of the secluse <<massive>> the pig is trotting along amiably with Nadia & Anna warily scrutinizing the windowless facade, her long slender fingertracings in the caulkjoints of the concrete panels, her handsoft touching my imagination, her strange teeth, the great windowless concrete volume is radiating warmth on its two daylight facades and soothing the umbrage with the retainment of its nocturnal tepidity on the two shady facades, the pig is foraging around the dimness where tall grass is thick against the foundation of the building she is finding a soft depression with her trotters are shuffling stationary into a trough exposing the bottom edge of the concrete panel, the sunlight behind the haziness with breakthrough radiance stippling the pinprickings of gauzy desiccation through the caulkjoints on the shadowy facade are bursting with tiny beadlets of luminance impossible in a conventional building with roof & interior contents--7 storeys deducing from the jointpattern of the concrete--, soft dirt is kicking up from the pig's hind trotters are clearing out the excavation talus into a small spoilheap, smoothly continuous concrete with flushraking of matching hue caulkjoints, window openings in the standard panel configuration are infilling with a secondary casting of concrete is discernible at the coldjoint in the absence of direct sunlight, completely solid windowless communal dwelling, the tomb imagery is proper but even in the laborious euphuism of ADA parlance is magniloquent, Anna & Nadia are approaching and kneeling where the pig is deftly snouting under the spanning bottom edge of the concrete panel across her excavation is forging forward beneath the panel to a small landslide of soft dirt and daylight is dustily breaking through into the hole from inside the hollow <<massive>> where her entire stout foresection is disappearing under the concrete, her back legs kicking dirt up out of the hole and forelegs digging further, a highly efficient quadripedal excavation methodology is completing the tunneling under the concrete wall is spanning a large hole swallowing her back legs disappearing up into bright the interior of the massive, the sunlight is palpable, drowning vessel, the inner facade of the concrete husk verrucous with concrete haunches for attachment of floorslabs, grain silo of photons, restriction of respiration by the warmth of dacha sunlight, Anna is removing her broadbrim hat and silkscarf unwindingly from her short hair projecting the colorful image of its decoration--red & gold roses clustering at the vertices & midpoints of the square amidst inward reaching posies of Nigella damascena and gold paisley buta swirling around brocades of very small daisies are casting loose blossoms & inflorescences diminishing inward over a white fieldzone--playing over her forehead and diffusing into her entire visage aureate & rosy & lavender and verdantly becoming part of the tallgrass is stillness is indexing the movement of the pig running joyously around a singlefamily dwelling secretly nestling within the enclosure of the hollow massive chamber, the concrete on the sunbaking interior facade is radiating, desquamation inside the concrete oven baking Anna skinpeelingly waving long pennants of translucent epidermis, columnar rendering of lifeless Anna in prokaryotic corneocytes is beautifully crumbling, the mound of Anna's skinpowder--the coquettish modesty of her dissolution--is filling me with deep longing for the aspects of death distinct from the physiology, she is persistently beguiling, everything along the ground is shady yet with emittance of a concentration of phosphorescent luminance from the numbing reflectance of the concrete deadend, reaching an orientation to the frontdoor of the ranchstyle dwelling typical in <<Hinkley Estates>> a concrete pathway is emerging from the wainscot of grass is hiphigh to a diminutive man in ADA coveralls is approaching hesitantly although with a pleasantly welcoming generosity in the squinting of his eyelids, the pig is emerging from the grass at his feet and snuffling him amorously, -- My name is Lavoisier -- flattening into the dimness Lavoisier is nestling shiftingly into a large creaking leather chair floating in a steppe of deep carpetpiling is orienting to the cancelling static of footprints, -- You are Here About <<the Bloodsucker>> -- · -- We are Lost -- · -- Yes I Know That And Yet You are Here Aren't You -- · -- This is Confusing -- · -- Anyone Here is Here About <<the Bloodsucker>> -- · -- Who is <<the Bloodsucker>> -- · -- Your Landlord Naturally -- enormous parlor with perimeter indistinguishable from kitchen or hallway or entry foyer, a house that feels wide open for entertaining yet the view out every window is a concrete wall, snoring pig beside a dormant fireplace, seeing the domecile inside the <<massive>> I've the unnerving awareness--the mechanically implausible awareness--that the setaside of this chamber and encountering Lavoisier within is a discrete cell of my existence occurring to somebody else, an episode I am reading about, a canto imprisoning poor intentionally hopeless Josef and I am Dante flitting through gawking at his misfortune with an inappropriate distraction as my fixation on a distant desirousness beyond the canto is consuming me, -- Annulment Of Large Real Estate Property Holdings Such As Those Under My Ownership Without Indemnification is Placing The Area That is Hinckley Estates At The Disposal Of A Regional Agricultural Committee And Eventually The Municipal Daemon is Executing A <<Writ Of Perpetual Usage>> For Ownership And Construction Of The Dwelling At Payriteskip, However, Platting Documentation Of The Payrite Entry In The Sannikov Housing Ledger is Referentially Extant In The Original Prerevolutionary ADA Chartulary Redbook That is Predating The <<Writ Of Perpetual Usage>>, Payrite isn't Doing Anything Superficially Improprietous But It is Puzzling To Me That The Physical Construction is Almost Distinct From Its Legal Existence In The <<Ledgers Of Private Dwellings>>, There Cannot Be A Loggable Entry Without An Existing Dwelling, The Splitranch Typology is An Invention Of The Daemon Precisely For Its Functionality As A Multitenant Dwelling, Both Picturesque And Consolidatory, With This Rationale Postrevolutionary Construction Of Freestanding Dwellings is Almost Unilaterally Splitranch, It is Somehow Perpetually Old And Perpetually New, Persisting And Emerging, I know Of Payriteskip Coming Into Existence, My Dwelling is Preexisting Hinckley Estates, What Good is My Word, I am Watching The Construction On My Acreage, I've The Ear Of Some Powerful Administrators, This is My Acreage In Possession Of The Daemon, This is My Dwelling Inside A Concrete Sheath, It is Not Just That <<The Bloodsucker>> is Clinging To His Virgin Landscape, It is The Disingenousness Of Its Usage, His Declaration That Its Dedication To Housing Exilees is Of Crucial Importance To The ADA, Isn't A <<Massive>> On That Culdesac Capable Of Housing The Disembodiment Of Far More Souls As Yourselves, If His Administrative Devotion is So Deep Why is He Clinging To The Obsolescence Of That Typology, Its Titillating Him, It is My Landcape, It is A Forest, Hinckley Estates is All My Possession -- what hue is this floorcovering, champagne & dead tree & cadaverous Onychodactylus fischeri & Salamandrella keyserlingii emerging from the permafrost of the parlor or livingroom is vastly horizontally rolling carpeting granularity foreshortening into thick noise consuming Nadia & Anna glancingly boosting one another's expectations that the panacea of Lavoisier's assertions are the solution to my predicament, is predicament an understatement, is understatement on overstatement of my significance, I know they know, they both know about each other, they is singular, at the pinnacle of the lightcone they, I'm sensing that entanglement in every engagement with either of them, conversations are wending around an absence, the refinement of their targeting, careful selection of phrasings for entrapment into increasingly damning admissions about the other, my most intrinsic refusal is against hopefulness, it is not that I'm pessimistic but reluctant for changing circumstances, however terrible a situation is a worse situation is necessarily possible, -- I am Ahead Of Myself, you see Payrite is A Fraud, is That Characterization Surprising To You -- · -- The Perception Of Something Inherently Devious In Payrite is Not Remarkable -- · -- Visualization Of These Social & Relational Scenarios is Necessarily Granular, As A Whole It isn't Sensical Without Segmentation Of The Whole With Refinement Of The Minutiae With A Loupe Or Framing A Territory Of The Whole With Rightangle Digits--Pollex & Indexical--Or A Bandlimiting Occlusive Template, In The Smallest Increment Of The Scenario is A Simple Machine Or A Singular Action Definitive Of The Whole, Solidstate isn't Solidstate N'est-ce Pas, In The Loupe We aren't Seeing Fractalation Or Repetition Only The Indivisible Scintilla, The Textural Spacefilling Of Scintillae is Emblematizing The Corruption Saturation Of His Entire Life With The Crime Of Only That One Small Increment is Resonating Its Miasmatic Iniquity Because As A Flea In The Broader Pano Of Staticky Noise It is Indistinguishable From All The Other Scrambling Fleas, Apologies I'm Being Obtuse -- inescapable polytopic nightmare -- Plainly, My Conjecture is Involving Consideration Of The Static On The CRT--Black On White Or Fleas On Stationery--Where Only One Of The Fleas Out Of The Hundreds Of Thousands is Carrying The Typhus Virus, Upon Ascertaining The Typhic Flea All The Fleas are Typhic -- · -- Yes You are Still Being Obtuse -- · -- The Analogy I am Constructing is Characterizing The Manner In Which Payrite is Up To Something is Hiding An Administrative Infraction--An Indiscretion Or Trangression--, His Posturing As An Administrative Devotee Notwithstanding, There is One Scintilla Of Untruth Somewhere In The Pano--That is The One Typhic Flea In The CRT Fleanoise--And That One Infraction is Always Enough For Damnation, is Precise Knowledge Of That Infraction Necessary, No, Knowledge That A Flea is A Typhus Vector is Enough For Associative Characterization Of All Fleas As Typhic, This isn't My Assertion, This is The Lens Through Which The ADA is Establishing Guilt & Innocence, You Of All People are Knowledgeable About That -- · -- I've No Such Knowledge -- · -- Oh No Sir, I'm Not Implying Your Guilt, I'm Not Suggesting Anything Beyond The Fact That The Only Causation Of Your Being In Sannikov With Payrite is Your Administrative Exilation, This is Not A Municipality For Carrying On With A Narrative Kind Of Life -- · -- I am Alive, I am Making The Effort, I am Following The Method -- · -- I've No Intention Of Offending You And I am Sorry--Caution Yourself To What You're Admitting About The Method However, I am Trustworthy, But Nobody is Trustworthy--If Ever You are Alive Yes You are Entanglingly Alive, There is A Conservation Of Such A Vital Status--Or Of The Vibratory Nature Of That Vital Status--, Analogous To My Static Analogy, If One Flea is Alive And The Remaining Fleas are Dead Then The Living Flea Bounding From Pixel To Pixel is Jostling Or Shuffling The Other Dead Fleas--Animating Them--Perhaps This is Another Futile Analogy, Recalibrating, If All Fleas are Inert And One Inert Flea is Alive All of The Fleas are Alive, It is Essentially A <<Slidingblock Dilemma>>--A 15puzzle For Instance, Or A <<Mysticsquare>>--Where A Single Vacant Cell is Enabling The Movement Of The Inert Gametiles Of Each Other Cell, You are Dead In All The Cells Except One And Alive In One Gametile With The Ludological Ability Of Occupying All Cells -- in the unreachable isolation the conical lamplight of Lavoisier's parlor Anna is cooling from the the vernation of her hair sweatmattingly enclosing her scalp in clingingly syntepalous flat seamlessly hastate topography gleaming mirrordome captitulum, her hair is curly drying without treatment, the cloudcover depth of her soft hair is rendering her enigmatically ironclad vulnerability into the swaddling of threadwaste, she is listening intently is placing the thumbside of her forefinger vertically along her nosebridge, -- What is The Vacant Cell In Your Analogy -- · -- That is Up For Interpretation Although The Reactive Assertion Of A Devotee Of The Administration is Erasure From The Platter--That Ominous Gatekeeper--Or More Simply Invalidation Of The Identity Although Someone Of Our Ilk -- · -- You & I We are Nothing Alike Sir, I've Common Knowledge Of Your Ilk And You are As Complicit In The Strangling Of This Population As Alpinist Himself -- Nadia is melting -- I am Certain Why That is Your Opinion But is My Appearance One Of An Active Cog In The Administration, I am A Methodist As You are And It is My Belief That The Vacant Cell In The Analogy is Redemption, An Involution Of The Identity is Making A Void For Folding Inward To Allowance For Lacking Existence--The Only Authentic Redemption is The Emptiness Of Preexistence, You Yourself Josef are Not Innocent, Your Antagonism is In A Way Complicitness--The Vacant Cell In The 15puzzle is Perpetually Vacant is By Definition Vacant, And By Definition It is Inaccessible To The Substantiveness Of The Gametiles Who In Every Movement Toward The Vacancy are Chasing It To A New Location, So In A Manner Of Understanding The Analogy The Activity Of Being Alive & Dead is Contingent On The Binary Separation Of Nonexistence From The Agony Of Living & Dying, Living is Perpetually Lifecycling & Perpetually Not Existing And Not Existing is Perpetually Not Existing & Perpetually Lifecycling, All Of This is Circumambulating That Payrite is Concealing Something And My Belief is That It is Something Dreadfully Ruinous, And I've The Standing For Initializing & Shepherding His Ruination, Few Prospects are More Rewarding To Me Than Ferrying Whatever Information You are Gleaning About Payrite's Misdeeds Up Through The Administration -- · -- With What Goal -- · -- The Annihilation Of His Eyesore Of A Dwelling -- · -- I am Innocuously Enduring Out My Penance In That Dwelling -- · -- Ah No That's A Mischaracterization, Your Condemnation is That Dwelling Itself, It isn't Your Exilation But The Integration Of Your Exilation To That Precise Dwelling, The Physical Existence Of That Dwelling is Insuring The Interminability Of Your Condemnation -- · -- aren't The Principles Of Your 15puzzle Analogy Governing The Dwelling As Well -- · -- Yes, Everything is Under The Conceptual Auspices Of The 15puzzle -- · -- To Wit The Dwelling is--Being In The Location Of Your Vacant Landholdings--Coexisting In The 15puzzle With The Absence Of Its Construction -- · -- Yes -- · -- And I--In The 15puzzle--am In The Reprievation Of That Absence -- · -- Yes -- · -- So The Destruction Of The Dwelling Or The Damnation Of Payrite is More Beneficial To You By Some Myopic Motivation -- · -- You're Misunderstanding The Analogy, Experiencing Our Existence is Not From Outside The 15puzzle, Where You've The Ability Of Observing Each Gametile And Assimilating With Visceral Immediacy How Each Of Those Status Encryptions In The Gametiles is Affecting Your Sensorium Or is Processing Through Your Cognition--The Cognition That is Your Cognition is Not Even Cohomologous With The Sensoria Of Other Gametiles Existing Beyond Its Domainwalls--For Your Consideration, If You've Awareness Of Another Gametile isn't It Reasonable That This You is Indulgingly Experiencing The Joys Of Your Liberation Instead Of Steeping Here In My Parlor, Or That You are A Child The Idylls Of A Vernal Morning Exploring The Tallgrass Deep Into A Rolling Meadow You are Lying Down In A Clearing From The Impression Of Your Body Pressing Down A Youmorphous Horizon Of Dead Winter Seedheads Defining A Blue Sky Congruent With Your Tiny Innocent Body, But No, You are Here, Prisoner In The Terror Of Loss & Hurtling Toward Annihilation With An Inability For Receiving Perceptions Scalarly Compatible With Reaching Through The Falsevacuum To Another Gametile Right Here Invaginatingly Colocal With This One, So Yes, The Dwelling At Payriteskip is Enduringly There And You are Enduringly Its Prisoner Lurking & Languishing In Its Basement, That is A Gametile, Our Gametile, Your Life is A Proportional Arrangement However, In The Infinitely Reducible Incrementality Of It are Scalar Modules--Childhood & Adulthood & Senescense, Illness & Vitality & Sleep, Orgasm & Satiation & Longing, Drudgery & Paranoia & Anguish--That are Static In Their Configuration To The Others, And Looking From Without--Which is Impossible From Within--, As A Biographer For The Sake Of Argument, Your Condemnation is Potentially Proportionally Half Of Your Life Or A Very Small Fraction, In The Slidingblock Dilemma Of Infinite Gametiles Isn't Your Preference The Minimum Possible Increments Of Imprisonment In That Bastard Of A Basement -- Nadia & Anna are enrapt with every tortuous argument and validation of Lavoisier's scheming against Payrite, this is stasis here at Payriteskip, my definition of a different possibility than this stasis isn't imagination or projection--I am in agreement with what Lavoisier is describing about the cellularity of our perceptions--itself an admission that forming expectations about anything but the characteristics of this exact situation is futile--, what I am capable of however is extrapolation, utilizing lucid & pragmatic & sober analysis on the geometric impossibility--of an interstitial medium expanding faster than the kernel of this situation is hurtling--it is apparent to me that anything but stasis in the ADA is a deathsentence, the unknowable haziness of Δ is nonexistence, my preference is for stasis, Δ=0 & sleeping & avoidance & floating & hypoesthetic, a common craving is for the stability and predictability of prison, the rapturous nonbeing of tormenting the nervous system, unimaginable depths of the administration's explorations of punitive methodologies, Nadia is peeling dermal sheets from Anna's back, dirty window daylight through the poreholes, daylighting white abyssal starry sky of the flayer, my impulse is for making a reproduction from her sheddings, there are enough skinpeelings for a translucent silhouette on the basement concrete, Anna is returning up the stairs to her apartment with footfalls smudgesounding in the floorstructure above Nadia is collecting all of the peelings into a gobbet and its shrivelingly squeezing dimunition in her fist to a chunk no larger than the fresh flaying of a fingertip is flicking it into the grass under the kitchen patio, it is my evaluation that Lavoisier's proposal is not redemptive--two whiny old reactionaries in an interminable deadlock of willpower, neither truly having any repercussion on the other--Payrite is loathesome but he is not the wellspring of my misery, we are drowning together--and yes he is standing on my shoulders chokingly aspirating the same piss--in the sewage of administration, the difference that he is serving the administration whose destruction or dismantling I'm desiring is inconsequential, but are those really such different responses to existence in abusive rigor, I'm not sympathetic to Payrite, my coping mechanism is selective ignorance, what is the functionality of limitless knowledge and effectiveness, is the possibility of noncommutativity affecting our condemnation our incrimination of payrite, are we flowing from his condemnation back toward his crime, the disorderliness of evidentiary findings is entropic in a way that is indicative of nascency, Lavoisier pressuring local authorities for the seizure & destruction of Payriteskip is doubly desirable in the municipal hierarchy--with all its surrounding properties vacant the construction of a new massive is feasible on the tract with all of its attendant incentives from the administration--we are questioning the necessity of another massive as the one containing Lavoisier's homestead is not even usable and per administrative development guidelines construction of a massive is not compulsory at the population threshold of Sannikov, -- The Functionality Of The Massive is Not Its Contribution To The Housingstock Of The ADA But As An Undertaking, Construction is Strength, It is An Emblematic Manifestation Of Administrative Dedication & Commitment And--Especially In A Community Such As Sannikov Where There is No Necessity It is Projecting Aspirations Of Optimism & Hopefulness For A Population Tumescent With Families & Laborers -- · -- My Vision is A Sannikov Tumescent With Exilees -- · -- That is The Inevitable Truth -- · -- Sannikov's Proximity--Or Lack Of Proximity--To Tsentergrad is Ideal For It's Role As A Purgatorial Penal Community -- · -- With All Of Its Attendant Incentives From The Administration --
