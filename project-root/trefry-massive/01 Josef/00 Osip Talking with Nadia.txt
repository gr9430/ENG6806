we are in a cavity beneath the lowest floor of a building in the collapsement of cardboard formwork is releasing a structural slab from unstable clays & sandy particulation (ADA soilreporting is overzealous) just beneath an accesshatch whose uneven enjambment is filtering in enough luminance that your sclerae are glowing irises are sparkling, dusty unblinking, lubricating the delicate scissorlift beneath the paperstack bier with lard (a fine yet austere elm wood coffin descending into the floor is straining the mechanism is squealing the screwlift (soaking in degreaser for removal of substandard lubricant) is requiring maintenance with the coffin halfway into the opening in the floor is delaying the funeral rite to the extent that several mourners (or ambivalent attendees) are assemblingly mobilizing on the altar are sitting atop the coffin is coaxing the action of the screwlift through a few revolutions and is stalling out with the lid of the coffin tantalizingly near coplanar with the carpet), we are in adjacent to darkness darkness (not outside of course but in our basement hovel (in our attic apartment (in our massive communal hostel)) is not even definitively darkness for the low quality of the drapery is shuddering with Payrite footfalls pacing in the kitchen over the single window is diaphanously projecting pinpricks of luminance are blooming in conical spotlight dissipation (the photon is not dying extinguishingly is extant in all regions (beyond accessible thresholds) in a lightpaste of itself) is sifting across your lips) is the locale that is resonating these things from me because you are asleep, I am transmitting to you in your absence despite you being my greatest supporter & most precious human being but because of those things I am making a fogginess of this ((that I am not daring a description is quite telling) what is the conceptual positioning of text in this endeavor, is it my interiority my vocality my monologue, or is it avoidant artifice) for swaddling you, I am happening upon some adulation for a writer describing them as a <<maestro of technique>> and I am curious what the implications are apart from an adherence to conventional standards of aesthetic perfection is being beholden to a neoclassical error in aesthetic refinement is accepting the idealization of the human (I am thinking of course of the elision of polychromy from architecture and sculptural representations with an effort of embracing the idealization of formal geometry instead of the amplification of the absurdity (true mimesis is confrontationally parodic) of the reality of human perception & cognition (human creations are too palliatively deceptive)) is the perception that the labors of the human are more alluring as pristine iterations of our physical presence instead of the hideous transcription of our perceptions or the clinical documentation of inhuman objectivity, in that way my supposition is that <<technique>> is the deceptive rendering (or underlayment) of experiential shorthand in a static medium is excusingly manifesting the worst minimizations of our mental reconstructions, my understanding of how this is playing out in visual representations and most particularly in sculpture is really unclear to me, the conceptual provocation is that visual art is a physical manifestation that is existing in the same material as the natural or quotidian world and although abstraction is the more alluring avenue it is a translation from cognition to physicality (although that is reductive, it is also being alive within the fluidity of the medium of the physical and not necessarily a translatory depiction of cognition, in this being alive though what is technique if not the inheritence of an application of arbitrary from representational endeavors or at the very least an investment in methodological congruency) and not physicality to physicality, even if these investigations aren't tedious they are certainly inconsequential but these are some of the considerations occupying me because my intellectual alignment is determining satisfaction with my efforts, my goal is adhering to the conceptual intentions of a project regardless of its aesthetic valuation, even if I am insistent on the aesthetic prescriptions guiding my decisionmaking they are not beneficial or for the satisfaction of a viewer beyond their appreciation of its internal consistency, now that is not suggesting that I'm not conscious of the viewer or knowledgeable of the mechanisms by which they are approaching a particular medium, in fact the entirety of my conceptual positioning is contingent on those mechanisms, what is the usefulness of translation if the landing place for the movement is not an equally prescriptively syntactical domain, ignorance of the theft occuring in all productive undertakings is intellectually dangerous, quoting Czech novelist Louis Armand <<all writing is collagic & all collaging is writing>>, in long perigrinations through Tsentergrad I am daydreaming about my philosophical affinity for Duane Hanson is sculpting in the posteriori meaning of the word (being a manifestation of a terminal result not a active engagement with mindful physicality) in that he is arriving at sculptures although the methodology is more aptly describable as fabrication (utilizing inelegant armatures and underlayments of any kinds of padding & packing material he is finding in landfills or in the areas surrounding his studio (rags & newspaper & plasticbags & papershreds are all binding together with elegant cinchings of a fine nonelastic meshy fabric akin to a fishnet but whose apertures are two trapezoids together broad edge to broad edge much in the geometric family of the coffin) for the raw formation of a human figuration that itself is quite beautiful in the way it is displaying the refinement of a workflow that is itself an armature for a series of more highly articulatable strata of fiberglass & fiberglass resin in with the detailing of dermal wrinklings (the crepey posterior of the knuckles) & foldings & blotchings & follicles & callouses & freckles & moles (or nevi (Spitz, Clarks, dysplastic, actinic, acquisitional, congenital))) and the resulting sculptures are insistently rejecting their status as artworks by endeavoring for verisimilitude with the most innocuous or peripheral characters of humanity (the museum securityguard, the overweight tourist, the middleage coffeeshop guy, the elderly grocery shopper, the shy child, the stridently unpublishable novelist, the housekeeper or custodian, the editor, the translator, the grocery stocker, the prisoner, K, the autopark attendant) perhaps with the goal of displacing the valuation of art products from aesthetic subjectivity (or authoritarian academicism) to fidelity (meriting a much deeper discussion of verisimilitude, Nadia are you distantly asleep enough that you are visualizing the impossibly innaccessible complexity of physical parameters of an eventblock, regardless of its scopic limitations such a system is visually elusive (the oneiric 3dimensionality and durationally gaseous material presence of a 6cube (a hexeract, a dodeca6tope, a dodecapeton)) and as such its depiction is impossible, what then are the aspirations of verisimilitude, the tendency toward verisimilitude as truthlikeness (paraquoting Graham Oddie, reconciliation of epistemic optimism with realism in the devourment of dismal induction is incumbent on a viable concept of truthlikeness & a viable accounting of the empirical indicators of truthlikeness & a viable accounting of the role of truthlikeness in cognitive valuation & all three accountings are fitting together with firmness & commodity & delightfulness) is more relevant than the pictorial (the putative functionality of visual (content basis) verisimilitude over a system (a text, a painting, an article, a statement) is deceptive is mimicking an axiomatic node with cognitive valuation although it is the system is not & is irrevocably distant from cognitively valuable or epistemic utility, this is not an assertion that systemmatic undertakings indulging in the deceptive qualitative Popperian <<Content Approachment>> utilizing logical probability as its innate encoding in the amassing of fallible human perception into a decisionmaking schema) smoothing over of this impossibility with caricatures of accessible shorthand representations of relatable durational scenarios where truthlikeness is a derivation of concepts within the discipline of settheory) & accuracy or more broadly its successfulness in not being art & not being conspicuously (or even upon the slight prolongment of surreptitious scrutiny that people are devoting to the vaguely abject) distinguishable from the quotidian environment, this is appealing to me Nadia because as fruitful as these undertakings are to me their conceptual conceit is that they are not noteworthy, an item that is factual is not noteworthy it is only extant, if artifice is assessable on some metric then the fact must not be assessable, if an item is not assessable it is not valuable, if an item is an undertaking it is necessarily physical (not purely cognitive), if an undertaking is not valuable it is necessarily of no meaning, if an item is of no meaning it is necessarily not inviting scrutiny (noise or gibberish is inviting scrutiny because it is evoking the qualities of a game (borrowing from Corrao, it is ludological)), if an item is not inviting scrutiny it is necessarily usable for something other than its intellectual or conceptual intent, if an undertaking is characterizable as supressing its meaning or intent it is artifice, facts are artificial, meaning is artificial, meaning is not useless but the establishment of its positioning & formation are necessary (or understand its social construction and its status within the conventional aspects of a text) for its distillation & isolation apart from the texturally objective framework of the quotidian, fixation on the social context (not what it is contributing to society but what aspects of societal functionality it is instrumentalizing) of my undertakings is a strategy for avoidance of not whether it is possible (if it is physical it is possible) but whether it is probable that other humans are engaging with my undertakings, ultimately what is important to me is the performance and the texturing of that performance is its flowingness is ebbing & aggression and how the engrainment of the performance is manifesting in the elusive & imprecise texture of the letterforms & lineation (the lineation of writing (with or without linebreaks) is unmistakeable from other textures) & kerning in such extreme reduction of meaning that the notion of informational verissimilitude (Oddiean & Niiniluotoian truthlikeness) is encrypting entirely in the rhythmic texture of the textobject, the truthlikeness of Agustín Fernández Mallo's rendering of actor Michael Landon (of <<Loving is Forever>> starring Laura Gemser (of <<Vow of Chastity>> &

<<true>> but its informational texturing is intertwining more with the scopic potentiality of the text (its congruity with the greater texture of its location in the bookobject of <<Nocilla Dream>>) than a righteous visually verisimilitudinous rendering of Michael Landon, is the underlying structural framework of the textblock apparently naturally occuring (text & texture are etymologically kindred but the suggestion that I am weaving a text is challenging my conceptions about the numinous preexistence of artifacts that I am more accurately dusting off than weaving), discovering a text not writing a text, you are using the word text frequently, it is a totemistic thing, an affectation, the activity of being frozen is the act of making an artifact (the marshalling of an event into a perpetuating negentropic eventlink (an identifiably material objectness that is the connective landmark (copula, vinculum, ligature) between one event and another (another way to think about this is that it is a registration marking for collating configurations from event to event) is characterizable by its theoretical inanimism)) in which the consciousness behind the artifact is necessarily enduring beyond the cognitive integral of an eventmesh (or cogneme), I'm desirous that the activity of my undertakings is static, I'm desirous that the undertaking itself is static, perhaps I've a distinterest in working and I'm preferring sitting & staring out the dusty window, a tree is growing where a man is cutting the tree down with an axe (a species with an exquisite grain, or burly with a burl containing the storms on Jupiter) is hauling a gigantic subterranean burl into a woodworking studio and taking a pristine example of its grain is planing it into rectangular prism of wood exactly 1cmx4cmx9cm (my woodblock, my urbirth, my totem, my affectation) and sanding it with successive iterations of increasingly finer grittinesses of sandpaper until they are rubbing it with newsprint, I am holding that burly woodblock with all of my fingers upon it, the death of the tree is emergent in new cellular growth from the burlwood not in an accretion that is changing its proportions or geometric configuration but through my fingertips and into the cellular tissue in my body is solidifying not unlike cancer but of a material that is not biologically active, in a novel by John Trefry is a description of a woman undergoing plastination in a bed in a motel room & an assailant is forcefeeding a young boy a resinous decoction of pineneedles & mustardseeds while fasting and although not in prayer or meditation his neglectfulness by his caregiver is creating a sokushinbutsu mummy from his body, superficial determination of whether he is alive or dead is nearly impossible, there is a very similar depiction in the movie <<Se7en>> (or <<Se7en: The Seven Capital Crimes>> or <<Capital Sins>>) in which a man is in bondage in a bed and an assailant is nursingly keeping alive (with minimal nourishment & consistent antibiotic treatment for bedsores) as a cautionary representation of slothlike vice is a nominally alive mummification, the poet Per Ohlin is of the belief that his blood is not moving through his circulatory system and as a child he is rupturing his spleen and is not alive as an adult and slipping into unconsciousness as a child where he is in fact entering death and how is it that in one eventblock this Per Ohlin is dead and further in the eventstack he is alive or that his body is in animation, we are accessing that knowledge from outside (or from deeper in the stacking (or from an intersecting stacking)) through our understanding of inanimate eventlinks, the hospitalbed in which Ohlin is dying is also the hospitalbed in which Ohlin is returning to life, it is not verifiable that the hospitalbed as a single datapoint in the collation, registration of whether all inanimate eventlinks in a cell are with those in the next is an inhuman task, but that is what is necessary for proof that Ohlin is alive subsequent to his death, of all the violence in my life I know that my death is one of stillness, the elucidation of the notion of a negentropic eventlink is most palpable in the facial characteristics of an actor (of very low industry stature) who is appearing in nameless roles in several movies over a quite wide eventspan (Lee Broker (or Lee Perkins) for example whose facial characteristics are distinctive enough are prompting the refrain <<hey there is „that guy“>> in each cellular manifestation of his cinematic appearances in <<The Thousand Plane Assualt>> (starring Christopher George of <<Mortuary>> (or <<Embalmment>> or <<The Hall of Death>> or <<Mortal Ceremony>>) & <<The Exterminator>> (starring George Cheung of <<I'm Demanding the Decapitation of Lance Henriksen>> & <<No Tomorrow>> & <<Shootfighter>> (starring Martin Kove of <<Shadowchaser>> in which he is portraying a prisoner masquerading as the architect of a building where a renegade cyborg (Frank Zagarino) is holding the daughter of the prime minister hostage) & <<Going Berzerk>> & <<The Astral Variable>> & <<The Enforcer>>) & <<Grizzly>> & <<City of the Living Dead>> (or <<Pater Thomas>> or <<Scariness>> or <<Twilight of the Dead>> or <<The Gateways of Hell>> or <<Terror in the City of the Living Dead>>)) & <<The Lawful Assembly Inside>> & <<F/X2>> ((or <<The Deathlike Illusion>> or <<The Deadly Art of Illusion>> or <<Who Is Murdering Who>>) in which Broker is portraying <<DeMarco>> who is watching his female neighbor showering is motivating him to homicide) & <<The Pyx>> (or <<The Hooker Cult Homicides>>) & <<Sally Fieldgood & Company>> & <<Businesspartners>> & <<Doubling the Negative>> (or <<Deadly Companion>> or <<Imperceptible Homicide>>) & <<Scanners>> (in which Broker is portraying <<Security One>> who is committing suicide by firearm) & <<Firebird 2015>> (or <<Halting the Velocity Phantoms>> or <<Nigthhounds of the Navmesh>>) & <<The Amateur>> & <<Utilities>> & <<Headoffice>> & <<Norman's Awesome Experiential Situation>>) such that they are ostensibly inanimate, that is me a nameless role is a ligature between my undertakings and the people ignorant of my undertakings, via that ligature it is entering their eventstack, if only I am in enough stillness am innocuous enough am the living dead, my reluctance of placing importance on my undertakings (this is not true), or perhaps more accurately my downplaying the importance with which I believe my undertakings are appearing to anyone but me (my reluctance in suggesting that my undertakings are potentially important to others) is a mechanism for avoiding the ambivalence of people intimately familiar with me, factually the output is more important than me so you've an understanding of where I feel people's priorities are when they are avoiding engagement with it, I am below the status of something people don't have availability in their lives for, my eyes are glazing stickingly in grogginess that opening wide & rubbing is not alleviating nor is it my preference that the blurriness is focusing back onto the textblock whose monospace (firmpitch or firmwidth or nonproportional) typeface is lacking identity & finesse in such a way that it is almost not text but asemic visual texture or patterning with the clinical torpor of the Socolar–Taylor tiling (an aperiodic 1tile (or einstein)) whose byzantine complexity is resulting in an assemblage that is infinitely variable and thus completely useless & bromidic & banal & uninspiring, is your headache lingering, would a warm rag be helpful over your sinuses, saltwater in your sinuses, the sensation of thrashing in the sea, the paperstack is accruing, the massing of the text is thrilling in the precision & efficiency of its geometry is eluding the information quantity of its composition is dissipating into the suggestive energies of its physiognomy, the ideal collation & storage of a text paperstack is within a voidspace in the floor containing a cassettebody with a regulating plate calibrated to depress (the pressurespring is overpowering the frictionsheet) where the mass of even a single paperleaf is depressing the plate such that the textface of the paperleaf is coplanar (controlling the overcorrection with a sequencing of torsionsprings are pulling the paperstack into levelness) with the surfacelevel of the floor and that with each paperleaf added to the paperstack is depressing such that the topmost textface is coplanar with the floor allowing its reading as integral to the woodgrain & tiling of the marquetry,
