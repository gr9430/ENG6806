two small cards of differing proportional dimensionalities one with an <<M>> one with an <<A>>, from my perspective glancing down across my sinking chest <<∀W>>, the vague pantomime of Cyrillic, depending on the serifs either way is nonsense <<USCH>> or <<TSSHCH>> or <<TSSH>>, all dismissive fricatives, a V full of fluid, ∀, gazing at the camera lens (gazing into the foramen of death from the posterior cranial fossa into the foramen magnum spillway all of the luminance & texturing it is elaborating upon flooding down disappearing) is glinting with rectangular fluorescent luminaires in the white featureless ceiling, a series of doorways, in custody, mugshot, goodbye, I'm hesitant of entering this event, it is (as is every voxel in my composition) unavoidable, yet I am exerting some agency in what is amounting to a tremendous amount of avoidance, avoiding finality, so much of my cognition is occupying this purgation (or the quilting together of incompleteness that is halting each cogneme at an arbitrary gelling status with the expectation that a completely discrete & skew other cogneme is capable of completing or lending stability or resonance to it and that cogneme upon which I am depending too is incomplete (the silent tacit bystander syndrome of a life partnership)) that its cessation is harrowing, haunting, whether by happenstance or subconscious this event is occupying the final status of my trajectory, the final materialization of my body as an effective agent on the world around me, the world I am endlessly composing through my being, my machinations & byproducts, I am reading about the discovery of chainreactions in the atom, the coalescence of many disparate scientists arriving in the vicinity of the same cognitive event and the way in which their musings & undertakings themselves are a chainreaction building from one to the next until they are contributing to the conclusion of a disastrous global belligerence by murdering 105000 people across the La Pérouse Strait, the ceiling & floor & perimeter of the apartment are all concrete, if I am allowing the sensation is constricting into a feeling of protectiveness, Nadia & I are within the entrainment of an airbubble within concrete, no discernible accesspoints, no possible connection to any other airbubbles without even the possibility of awareness of any other airbubbles, opacity is a comforting trait in the presence of death, I am orienting the armchair away from the window & doorway in the studio apartment is a blank vertex where the small bookshelf is along with an umbrellastand and atop the bookshelf is a vase where native grasses & wildflowers materializing freshly once they are dead, Nadia appearing & disappearing in front of the armchair, a text on the thin bedspread across my legs, turning pageleaf, scanning absently, <<Väter der tausend Sonnen>> by Joel Polis (on the espionage efforts by Karl Fuchs in service of Alpinist), <<The Maestro & Margarita>> by Bulgakov, in the street with Anna, -- I am Ceasing Reading And Planning Only Making And Writing And Composing, No Ingestion Now Only Digestion Of It All Only Regurgitation And Playing With The Egesta -- , I am all blustering, inside is silentness, no inside, the outsideness is passing through me, looking at the text in front of me, <<Massive>> by John Důmnakopci, nonsense, definitely a predecessor to <<Tvoy raspad ty vidish' po svoyemu zhelaniyu>> by not a worthy one, the newspaper, folding the newsprint over as silently as possible, the changing luminance on the concrete is suggestive, from out of brightness (compounding of reflections of lamplight or streetlight) Nadia lowering to her knees is placing her forearms on my knees is murmuring with her cheek on her forearms, -- The Conversation With Brodsky is A Deadend -- , weightlessness, -- Pasternak is Bringing The Bookshelf From The Tsentergrad Apartment, It is The Very Least He is Saying He is Capable Of But Also The Most -- , Nadia is emerging from the wall between the spines of <<Smiley's People>> & <<Rich Guy, Poor Guy, Beggar, Thief>> and walking around behind me, evaporatingly padding across the concrete onto a rug softening, doing my best in ignoring her graceful yet purposeful footfalls belying a greater extent to our apartment than just this small opaque vista, emerging from the porousness of the hasty substandard (the ADA is abandoning the wastefulness of formrelease agents necessary for striking a fine finishsurface in lieu of spalling & sticking cementcrust to the formliner is subsequently casting impressions of previous panel negatives) concrete, the autotransport is depositing us within an undifferentiable yet locally inconsistent fieldscape of massive clusterings each grouping around a common of peagravel (enhancing the imminence of jackboot marching) with long solid concrete pews (each common is containing 3 columns of 27 pews each where the aisles between every third row are wide enough for discernibly creating 9 groupings of 9 across the columns) where massive residents are sitting having soft conversations or reading pamphlets or gazing at enought altitude that they are looking over the cornice (the exposure of the buttjoint of the roofpanel sitting atop the wallpanel with spillover caulking guttae bleeding down the panel) of the nearest massive, the sky above the narrow alleys between massives isn't providing directional guidance, no shadowcasting no orientation, Nadia is leading me by the hemline of my thin windbreaker, above each doorway flushfit in its jamb is an alphanumeric identifier (approximately 10cm tall (in the basin of each formliner is an apparatus of 9 scrolling character discs with 32 graphemes & 10 numerals are generating 161,805,220,012,800 possible identifiers (only the panel over the door is presenting the identifier on the facade where all other identifiers are orienting to the interior of the building (concrete batching & massive construction are not coordinating for allowing the construction of massives utilizing panels with particular identifiers in sequential adjacency to one another (to wit TTO8R5K79 & JEKR6BL04 are neighboring one another (providing a compatriot with the identifier of your massive is futile)))))) for each building, upon arrival I am not leaving the massive, involuting, no longer thickening but subdividing for more effective pulverization, over the waterfall such that no retraction is possible no inhalation it is too thick too full, I am relinquishing my readings & viewings & conversations although they are lingering here, jettisoning, I'm desirous of being lighter & more fleet, this heaviness is the inescapable cultural knowledge of the platter, as much as my disbelief is unburdening me the entirety of me on this trajectory is granite sinking under the accessibility of the entirety of human knowledge (not in the byzantine bowels of dozens of libraries but in my being with immediacy (electricity knowledge, luminosity knowledge, immolation knowledge)) with the tendency of feeling inescapable, I've awareness that death is escaping, suicide is tremendously difficult and seemingly futile considering the imminence of death regardless, the transitcamps are not burying their corpses, pyramidal improvisations are the happenstance resultant of dumping corpses with a snorting bulldozer, corpse pyramid with my visage glassy gazing out from its facade, this event is locking into the sequencing as the branchings are narrowing, jackboots in the gravel, asymptotic devagation is the realization that the fixation on nodules & strange moles & abcesses & acute paincenters & hairloss & earhair growth as any symptoms or indices of falling from oldage to death (bypassing senescence) is the cessation of worrying about the body and the dilation of the pupils onto the vague windowpane (pictureplane) of annihilation, the pupil is swallowing the body, the footfalls of crunching jackboots echoing from the facades of phalanges of massives dark endless marching through the pupil, bilateral fixation of pupil dilation in the setting of transtentorial herniation due to spaceoccupying lesions, decompressive topological surgery, trepanation of the voronoi is leaking the fluid fillcolor across the pupil blackness, the sea of the iris, il Mare dell'Iris, More Irisa, the sea of darkness, <<Eibon>>, New Orleans, Lake Ponchartrain Causeway, Metairie, Monroe, Madisonville, More T'my, the realization is not the arrival at the distinguishable nadir of the asymptote but that the deathyawn of the pupil is a dark endless extrusion along the worldline of the asymptote, constant dying, any crosssection of the extrusion is containing death or annihilation, the being is lacking solidity is vague, a microscopic investigation of the pupillary frill is revealing (into the crypt of Fuchs (deep enough that we are dining on Zeppollelle di mare & Fritelle alle Alghe of the iris tissue)) an immeasurable coastline of ciliary pigmentation (not a harsh boundary but a graduation from legible variegation of pigmentation to total absence), even in such indeterminate statuses a definite binary is extant, a general fieldspace of life & a general fieldspace of death, however the fieldspace of life is a superimposition of an endless fieldspace of death is underlying as a substrate, through periodic foramen is visible the void beneath, an entire lifetime for Nadia without me, I am visualizing her collapsing into Anna, the two of them are something without me without my burdening Nadia is capable of flight, into the nightsky, an apartment with wood flooring, retiring with Anna to the dacha, carefully crafting her life, gardening in a broad floppy hat, two orange cats in sunlight (one asleep in the lettuce the other crouching in futility beneath the hummingbird (who, with the housefly, is existing with an awareness of spatiality in the eventscape at far smaller & pleatingly involuting dimensionalities than a blunt & crude human is capable of) feeder), a studio dwelling at the edge of the forest with its windows wideopen, the hottest days are pleasant enough (the coldest are bearable (barely) with the tiny woodburning stove is burning wood in smaller diameters than a forearm and far shorter), napping after morning coffee, stretching her spine, automatically coiling her long hair in a bun, hiking along the gravel road by her dacha she is encountering a cow alone by the fenceline is assembling from the physical depths where feverishness is implanting the accessibility of discrete events the vision of the cow in Sannikov as we are walking from the autotransport to Payriteskip Nadia is barely conscious and instead of an innate & radiant & placeless joy of communing with a beast she is resolving the undertaking of documenting the entirety of her life both with & without me, the dacha is in Kuz'movka & beside Lake Epekli & Novorybnaya & Kairouan & Green River & El Corrozal Viejo on Isla Ometepe in Lago Cocibolca & on the seaside of Palermo on Via Gallo & the dacha is in Osijek & Kecel & Snyatyn & Lunga Nouă &

panacea for typhus & tuberculosis & hepatitis & scabies & alcoholism (I am an alcoholic (finis)) & shigellosis & hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) &  infidelity & diabetes & bacterial vaginosis & death

tuberculoid leprosy & black piedra & candidid & favus & angular cheilitis & creeping eruption & annular lichen planus & halo nevi, all of these a Nadia is suffering and from which all of these Nadias are finding respite at the idyllic dacha, every ailment or irritant, all coming claiming the body, it is only requiring one, each Nadia a fugitive (ephemeral, fugacious, running, transitory (moreso)) from the one that is intending her demise, the firingsquad, the trebuchet, hanging, tearing apart, or malaria, or pancreatic cancer, each is the same dacha with a black dwelling with white trimming under a simple gable, tallgrass, lespedeza , alfalfa, jerusalem artichoke, a giant elm tree, the sun is rising atop a slowly grading hillside & setting through a thick forest along a creekbed, the orientation is consistent (as with the construction of a cathedral or mosque anywhere on earth), Nadia fleeing (materializing) from one to the next without leaving, the <<WBYM>> is arriving at the Dikson dacha and Nadia is not there, she is at the Mazara del Vallo dacha & the Drovyanoy dacha & sitting ((each sitting is manifesting a fragmentary thought (a cogneme (the smallest measurement of thought possible is slipping out in the instant she is occupying that particular dacha)) that is bookmarking the knowledge landmark from which a larger coagulation is thickening until it is abutting or graduating into the boundary of another landmark thickening)) in a stiff Hitchcock chair in the Scituate dacha looking out over the precipice of a cliff into the sea beyond a large boulder seawall, in each singleroom dwelling is the desk, at this desk she is writing & preparing her meals & eating her meals & , on the bed beneath the single window she is doing many of the same things, in each dacha she is sitting at the table she is sitting on the bed writing only a few phrases (fragmentations & thickenings of she & I & Anna & Marina) arriving at a flowstate in which the words are coalescing with a vibration beyond their contents is venturing into the gestalt wholeness of a kitchen midden (the analogy I am using frequently is that of a chessboard (in that the structural mechanism of the 10grid (the 10grid is large enough for building up a criticalmass of gridsquares & small enough to be visualizable as a single thing and not a terrain) is unifying any assortment of 100 items in arrangement upon it) upon which is the arrayal of a collection of extraordinarily (inordinately, excessively, numbingly, immoderately (desperately random)) disparate items), it is not that is death I am with her, it is that I am (upon the ratification of my physical existence (a subjective & affective thingy)) the entirety of human knowledge & stimulus accretion shuffling the events of my life with the events of Nadia after my death, this is conventionally the subjectmatter of daydreaming (I am curious what Nadia is doing in the event of my death, how is she living her life without me) about proximate entities & items (the chair that I am leaving in the street who is sitting on it in what dwelling is it taking residence), this isn't Nadia or her life or afterlife of course but me & my vision of her drifting toward me & away from me through outerspace or undersea or she is walking toward me on a narrow roadway far from the citycenter of Florence we are looking backward toward one another walking away and then what, I've no recollection, am I following her or is there another happenstance rendezvous, we are meeting on the plinth of Santa Croce beneath a headless statue, this isn't Nadia, who is it, everything is artifice and in all earnestness I'm desirous of nothing less that the most inventive of frauds, what is the undertaking of passing through life but the trajectory of a trebuchet firing the strange human body into an atomizing conflagration, foamy, soupy, human bodies all intermingling such that who is Nadia and who are the Nadias thickening & branching into vain (nugatory, barren, fruitless) redundance such that there is no Nadia but the infinity of Nadias are all in flight from the <<WBYM>> for the felony of loving a prideful (lusty & envious) antagonist, poking the giant, he is awakening, with immediacy, the coldsweat of realization & regretfulness, persistent lowgrade nausea, awakening in the chair in the massive, jackboots in gravel, jackboots in the corridor sounding the same as jackboots in gravel, staring at the concrete, entering the concrete, clinging to the concrete, breathing slowly & deliberately, slower, not at all,
