with a preference for the most remotely impersonal execution of the hog that is consistent with daemonic strictures of husbandry and abbatoir etiquette, Payrite--through the involvement of tortuous convolutions in his sprawling avoidance of any straightforward modalities--is embracing the experimental euthanasia methodology of biochemically active nanoparticle injection into a pedicle archway of the small pig's vertebrae, the banefully proliferant package delivery upon the relative torrent of influxing capillary fenestration is leeching into the cerebrospinal fluid, this specious diffusion of responsibility is satisfactory to Payrite, with the mercurial nature of death in this execution method his--the executioner's--presence is unlikely with the hog dying mysteriously from the catalyzation and reaction of tiletamine and xylazine in his ependymal canal, the hog is not dying, Payrite is requisitioning the construction of a carbon dioxide euthanasia chamber, the ersatz finishcarpenter Denari--or Denira--is honing planks of barnwood down through troughs of wormtrack devourment for the removal of checking and wracking imperfections for deeply dipping each plank in gesso--his own concoction of wallboard pulverization and rehydrating prills of urea isolation from swine urine--prills of his own spherification in a <<massive>> stairwell full of rainwater and lacking its stairs--this rind of gesso is drying and receiving a preparation of dampeningly adhesive sizing from steeping the dermis of a great gray ray for the reception of goldfoil contraband candy wrappers gilding, application of anaerobic impregnant sealant to the joints of the chamber, the measurements of the rectangularly prismatic euthanasia chamber 76.708cm x 42.672cm x 50.038cm are a constraint of the available lumber and joinery preferences rather than the dimensions of the hog--the dimensions are of such unsuitability that the executioner is forcing his head down between his forelegs and snapping the costrachondal junctions of his fore and aft ribs and fully fracturing fully the more conspicuous midsection ribs--liberating the marrow for a more luxurious broth--compressing him under a lid with a sheetcork gasket, a two way vacuumhood over a portal on the lid of the chamber for the exchanging of common atmosphere for pure CO2 with a flowrate of 20% per airchange, at 20% CO2 the hog is frantically scrambling for liberation with bounding pulsation of the blood, at 40% CO2 the hog is gasping in exhaustion his pallor is mottling, at 60% CO2 the hog is gasping in asphyxiation with irregular pulsation of the blood, at 80% CO2 the hog is delicately asterixically paddling his trotters, at 100% CO2 full hypercapnic asphyxiation is successful, the hog is not dying, his bloodgas not reaching the fatal 10kPa threshold is traceable to the alveolar content and especially boyant skincells of the great gray ray is allowing for breathability of the gesso on the chamber, the executioner is lifting the lid from the chamber is startling awake the hog from his hypoxic stupor wrackingly throwing his great snout upward is kissing the limp daylight of the pineforest through the high abbatoir window startling the executioner is lifting the hog and flipping it trotters up he is squealing and shallowly arching his spine contrary to porcine resting posture maximizing the representation of his anguish & terror to a radius on the basis of the pronouncement of the dorsal spinous processlets are radiating inward to collison--bone scraping bone is a gristling of extreme agony--he is shreiking for Nadia's embrace and with great frustration throwing him onto the concrete floor, the hog lying on its side with a trotter limply gesturing his resignation is gazing absently plaintive through narrow lashes of his left eye or kicking the pig over and on his knees in the basement abbatoir the executioner is beating the pig in the skull with a small hammer, <<the requirement is that livestock chambers & driveways & ramps are receiving proper and thorough maintenance>>, <<the requirement is that livestock crates & driveways & ramps are without sharp or protruding objects that are injurious or painful to the animals, this is inclusive of but without limitation to loose lumber & splintery or splitting planking & unnecessary apertures where the head or feet or legs of an animal are susceptible to injury>>, <<the requirement is that floorplates of livestock crates & ramps & driveways are of construction--gritty slipresistance & waffly embossings & relief augmentations to inclinations--and maintenance that is providing adequate footing for the animal, utilization of sandiness over iciness is preferable>>, <<the requirement is that the circulatory arrangement of livestock chambers and driveways is striving for the reduction disorienting switchbacks and acute turnings>>, <<the requirement is that promotion of relaxation and idyll is the goal in driving animals from the unloading ramps to the holding chambers & from the holding chambers to the „stunning area“, including a prohibition of driving animals at velocities more rapid than an average gambol>>, <<on the topic of driving animals to the „stunning area“ this codification is only inclusive of recommendations for ideal procedures and with dependence on the opinion of an ADA inspector visavis these slaughter protocols, limitation of electric prodders & canvas slappers, minimization of excitement & injury--terror is promoting a sourness of the fleshmeat--, the requirement is for stepdown of electric prodder voltage by a transformer to 50V or lowest effective voltage, staves & swords of injurious significance are not permissible for driving livestock>>, <<on the topic of impudent or listless or paralytic or succumbing animals--„sleepers“--with the inability or disinterest for locomotion this codification is only inclusive of recommendations for ideal procedures, separation of „sleepers“ from normal ambulatory animals to a shady enclosure, dragging of conscious „sleepers“ is not permissible--stunning „sleepers“ with a firearm is instating permissibility of dragging--, transportation of conscious „sleepers“ is permissible with the use of a stoneboat>>, <<on the topic of euthanization of livestock with gaseous CO2 this codification is only inclusive of recommendations for ideal procedures, construction of a tunneling chamber--a large diameter tubular construction--whose morphology is capitalizing on the higher specific gravity of CO2 with the introduction of a lowlying portion of the chamber that is passively constraining the gas--either at the lowpoint of a sagging straightline or Uform switchback--at a concentration proportionally fatal with the velocity of the automatic conveyor driving the animal through the chamber, provision spacing of impellers allowing each animal privacy in death, minimization of excitement & injury--euthanasia is less violent with docile animals--, confirmation of death is necessary for shackling & sticking & bleeding, reduction of electrical equipment in the vicinity of CO2 depression, flowing conveyance of animals is under the purview of a single operator, elimination of sharp projections or exposure of flywheels & gears, elimination of unnecessary holes & gaps & openings prone to snaring the feet or legs of animals>>, flowrate of animals into and through the gaschamber is dependent on one operator, operation or stoppage of the conveyor is entirely dependent upon this operator, overdosages and premature death of animals are consequences of a lackadaisical operator, the ability for maximally efficient performance of CO2 euthanizing equipment is dependent on its proper fabrication and efficient mechanical operation, pathways & compartments & gaschambers are properly accommodating the species of animals for euthanasia, prohibition of traumatic restraining devices, prevention of premature injury of animals by the elimination of sharp projections & wheels or gears spinning without protection, no unnecessary holes & gaps & openings admissible to feet or legs of animals, impellers or other devices for mechanical movement of animals is of flexible construction material, mechanical activation of passageways for constantly streaming animals to euthanizing equipment is not injurious, proper maintenance is essential for the assurance of safety to the animal prior to their euthanization, proper maintenance of a uniform carbon dioxide concentration & distribution in the anesthesia chamber is achievable with the inclusion of reasonably accurate diagnostic instruments for collection & analysis of CO2 concentration within the chamber throughout anesthetizing operations--maintenance of a constant CO2 concentration--, vaporization of CO2 to euthanasia chambers is a reduction of solid CO2 ice, sampling of vapor for analysis is necessary at intermittent & continuous locations in the gastunnel deathsequence with graphic visualizations of CO2 concentrations & exposure durations available to the operator in hardcopy binders, presence of noxious or irritating miasmas in the CO2 & common atmosphere of the euthanasia chambers is not permissible, periodic maintenance of the CO2 & common atmosphere mixing nozzles & ventilators and periodic instrument & indicator calibration are preventative of contamination of the gastunnel with nonuniform CO2 concentrations responsible for premature euthanization in the deathsequence are preventable with access to dilution with ambient atmosphere, the slaughtering of cattle & calves & sheep & swine, goats & horses & mules by shooting with firearms in compliance with the provisions of humane methods of slaughtering and handling of such animals under the <<ADA Nutrition Stability Provisions>>, delivery of a bullet or projectile into the animal is producing immediate unconsciousness in the animal by a single engagement and with a minimum of excitement and discomfort, deathsequence driving of animals to the shooting areas with a minimum of excitement and discomfort to the animals, delivery of placid animals to the shooting area is essential to accurate placement of the bullet is difficult in situations with nervous animals, lowvoltage prodding is acceptable, assurance of complete unconsciousness throughout shackling, sticking and bleeding, firearms dispatching free projectiles or bullets of varying sizes and diameters through the skull and into the brain are producing unconsciousness by a combination of physical brain destruction and alteration of standard intracranial tension, assuring uniform unconsciousness of every animal with every smallbore firearm discharging is necessitating usage hollowpoint bullets or frangible ferroplastic composition bullets or ferropulverous missiles, utilization of ferropulverous missiles are most effective with minimal proximity to the skull of the animal, proper firearms maintenance, direction of firearm discharging is toward ballistically receptive wallcovering, safety devices on all firearms are insuring the protection of laborers & inspectors, jurisdictional provisions covering the stunning area are also applicable to the shooting area, the exacting procedure of accurate alignment of the projectile is producing immediate unconsciousness, proper firearm caliber & powdercharge & ammunition is producing immediate unconsciousness, selection of firearms & ammunition--caliber and choice of powdercharge--for production of immediate unconsciousness is dependent on the age & sex of the animal, data is suggesting usage of smallbore firearms on bulls & rams & boars is producing immediate unconsciousness, smallbore firearms are effectively stunning heifers & cows & sheep & swine & goats & calves & horses & mules, in the basement abbatoir an <<ADA NSP>> inspector is observing a despondent and tremoring laborer is mishandling and inhumanely slaughtering a small pig resulting from deficient facilities & equipment in disrepair is tagging the equipment & driveway & holding
