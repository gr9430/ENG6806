particles are unencumberingly venturing along pathways of the shortest possible measurement (or geodesics), particles are endeavoring movement solely on straightlines but in a milieu of meshspace of curvature no straightlines (in the Euclidean definition (lacking curvature)) they are banking on radii and warping through the turbulence of meshspace,

the item flying through the air is accelerating less than the item sitting on a table (the item sitting on a table is deflecting away from the geodesic of its preference) which is the origin of the heaviness of the human body against the earth, 

the curvature of meshspace is very small (particles are moving slowly in comparison to photons) such that Newtonian mechanics (although only an approximation of the whole tale is lacking the incongruities & inconsistencies that are impossibly situating into a general vantage of the whole) is more broadly applicable to the experiential data of human sensation,

meshspace is 9dimensional collection of locations, in the terminology of meshspace an individual location is an <<event>>, the pathway of a particle is a curveline (or sinew or arabesque, preferrably sinew) through meshspace, parametricizing a 1dimensional collection of events in the terminology of meshspace is the <<worldline>>,

meshspace is not completely structureless although no viable definition is existing for two discrete yet <<concurrent>> events, an event is defineable by its lightcone (the locus of pathways through meshspace that are viably containing lightrays passing through the event), in lieu of the absolute division (the Newtonian integral slicing on the basis of any pertinent variable) meshspace is simply constraining all movement pathways within the lightcone, 

an eventscape is a 3dimensional spatiality (not three fundamentally 1dimensional systems in arbitrary collaboration), although an event location is defineable by three distinct (1dimensional) components these distinct components are not characterizing the whole which is capable of rotation & manipulation within the 9dimensional meshspace without changing any of its 3dimensional measurements, situating an event in the 9space of meshspace is requiring an inertiaframe, 

a collection of meshpoints (massiveness) are all in conformance with a single event by the inscription of straightlines within its lightcone, meshpoints outside the lightcone are spacelike and meshpoints on the sheathing of the lightcone are lightlike, 

to each intersection of meshspace is the association (or tangentspace) of all possible (or extant) vectors at the intersection,

the relational dynamic of meshspace intersection within an event (intraevent dynamic) is dependent on the complex geometry of the worldline and the Boolean spatiality (tangentspace) of all lightcones originating on the worldline, the shortest measurement between two intersections is 0 (in an a overly simplistic illustration of this Weir punching a pencil through the doubling over of a centerfold he is pulling from over the bunk of a fellow oblate ( -- Begpardon, That's Vanessa, And That's My Centerfold -- )), the longest possible measurement between two intersections is a straight trajectory, all measurements between are falling on circlings of radii between 0 & a radius such that it is producing a straight trajectory, 

a 1vector is an intervector cartography (from vector to vector, from 1form to 1form, an identity mapping, the Kondracke tensor) a dual vector (2vector) is a linear cartography (a tensor, a ranking, a multilinear mapping from a collection of dual vectors), 

all tensors in meshspace (the metric tensor, the inverse metric tensor, the Kondracke tensor, the <<Levi Civita symbol>> tensor) are transforming in accordance with the tensor transformation such that their components are adaptable in constant proportional conformance in any intertial meshspace,

parentheses & squarebrackets & curlybrackets & chevrons & lenticulars & cornerbrackets (floor & ceiling) & Quine vertices & halfbrackets & 2brackets & spiky parentheses are denoting symmetrization & assymetrization & skew & coplanar & spatialization & illumination & amassment & ascending & descending & static,

no individual momentum for a particle, the system is a fluid continuum with parametric quantities such as density & entropy & viscosity & fluidpressure, although such a fluid is the composition of many individual particles with different 4velocities (the tangent vector of a traveler on a massive (masslike) worldline) the fluid iteslef is an overall 4velocity fieldstate, the fluid is defineable by its parameters not the individual statuses of its molecules, 

duststuff (oblates are using <<matterstuff>> as a synonym for duststuff) is defineable in flat meshspace as a collection of particles resting relative to each other, the 4velocity fieldstate is the constant 4velocity of the individual particles (its components are the same at each intersection defining the numberflux 4vector is the numeral density of the particles measurable in their restframe),

a perfect fluid is one that comprehensively specifiable by two quantities (the restframe energy density specifying the fluidpressure in every direction & an isotropic restframe pressurestate),
