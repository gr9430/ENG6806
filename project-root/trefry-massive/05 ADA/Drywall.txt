paraffin wax is an exceptional heatstorage material--with a specific heatcapacity of 2.14 to 2.9 J/gK and an enthalpy of fusion of 200 to 220 J/g--exploitable as an infusion into drywall for residential construction is meltingly absorbing warmth in the daylight and solidifying in the cold darkness releasing the warmth, utilization of remainder drywall chaff as a supplemental contributor of calcium & sulphur as a soilconditioner in crop production is diverting 4 to 10 extraneous tonnes per hectare of farmland, analysis of leachable heavymetal concentrations from soilsamples containing the drywall enhancement in a dataset establishing a comparison to regulatory thresholds assessing potential endangerment are illustrative of metal concentrations below the allowable datapoints for farmland application, young families--some hopeful fatherfigures & some weeping children--moving from the surrounding village into a virgin <<massive>> are carrying their possessions on handtrucks or small wagons, no elevators, demolition crews crushing hovels and cabins leaving steamrollingly flat ruination in undergrowth is growing above the remnants decaying into the dirt, venturing up through the concrete staircases with bleak cold milklight weeping through high windows into the cozy interiors of <<massive>> apartment units with tapestries & niches with candles & banquettes & patchwork rug flooring & wallcoverings & particolor glass torchiere & houseplants--Aristolochia serpentaria, Lilium auratum virginale, Anthurium gymnopus, Amorphophallus konjak, Tillandsia lindenii, Cypripedia

portraits & velvet bunting & slipcovers & chaise & wood paneling & roomdividing curtains & orderly bookshelves creating a warm and swaddling homeplace belying the harshness of their patchwork concrete facade, wood furringstrips or steel channelfurring over concrete panel is providing a conducive fastening substrate for drywall is rendering the cellular nature of the construction type with ersatz domesticity of dimply matte warmth, the additional thickness of furring & drywall is enabling usefulness of partial height partitions--typically dividing one cell into a kitchen and parlor--as a shelf for houseplants or tchotchkes, a reglet running around each chamber at 200 cm is dividing the partition into a pale blue lower portion and a luminous white ceilingvault zone where a high window to the corridor is in alignment with the security lighting on the ceiling whose circuiting is not passing through a lightswitch is luminously into everywhere else in the <<massive>> is darkness and slumbering residents in sleepmasks under the glaring security lighting, inflammation of the baseboard moulding is manifesting a small ersatz stepstool below the square transom window from the hallway into each apartment, down the northforking roadway to the terminus of Prospekt Ulitina, the fenestration in concrete patchwork rising from the woods beyond the greensward, a phalanx of ADA <<Urban Termite>> brigades wending over a berm weedchokingly swaying idly flat cloudlight accumulating luminance in the broad south facade of the Pervomaiskii <<massive>> #15352 are filing into the vestibule unsheathing drywall jabsaw with tribevel serrations--nonconductive handgrip over its tang--are hunting for contraband depositions in wallcavities against the sillplate filling the voidspace beneath a dummy electrical socket, the common discovery of chocolate & fruit in syrup & pornography & electric razors & money & teeth & flashingstones is inconsequential against consideration of firearms & knives & dissident manifestos & epistolary conspiracies against the administration are prompting administrative declarations calling for the removal of all drywall from ADA <<massives>>, removing windowpanes for easy disposal of drywall demolition laborers wearing thick leather gloves are heaving fragments & entire panels of drywall lofting through the rectangular aperture is rotatingly plummeting in a bright cirrus of gypsum powder to the heaping midden in the grass, excusing the systematic destruction of every <<massive>> dwelling unit in the ADA by referencing the relatively pervasive problem of miasmatic sulfide emission from importation of Eastasian drywall, frontloaders are pushing drywall middens scrapingly across the tallgrass <<massive>> intersices into pinetree copses, reinstallation of windowpanes without weatherstripping or caulking sucking cold gales into featureless concrete chambers, bedsheets and polyethylene plastic sheeting over window openings, respiratory moisture on the inside of the glass is freezing, rotting eggs emission of sulfide miasma from Eastasian drywall is corroding electrical wiring & contaminating fabric & spoiling the hermetic ecosystem of airconditioning systems & delicate mechanisms of various appliances, sulfide emissions are responsible for pervasive mesothelioma in at least 100,000 dwelling units of the ADA, calcinous gypsum with additives in a waterbath is forming a slurry thickening into a cakebatter consistency for application between continuous layers of bindingpaper on a boardmachine, synthetic gypsum is a byproduct primarily from the desulfurization of the fluegases in coal powerplants, they are awake all through the night--the tomb and its servants--beneath argent corrosion of mercury halide gaseous luminance whose formless icepalace is cooling the tepid powder nominally <<powderbloodclot>> running from the slit brachial artery scalpelingly weilding man in hazmatsuit, the servants of the tomb are luminous--in the same manner--in the glow of an unstoppably dying presenttense, daemonic literature is ignorant to the fantasy existent in carcinogenic hexahedra within the limitation of rectangular cubiods slumbering, We want to exalt movements of aggression, feverish sleeplessness, the doublemarch, the perilously leaping demolition worker, the slapping and the blowing of the bloody fist in a gypsum crucible, a technician is arranging samplesets of drywall fragmentings in an environmental chamber is running a diagnostic screening for the two chemicals--or familial chemcompounds--of hydrogen sulfide & sulfur dioxide, taping copper stripping to drywall panels for diagnostic exploration of black copper corrosion, suspicion is falling more credibly on ferrous materials & ferrous disulfide--impurities of ferropyrite--a chemcompound not presenting through diagnostic screening of domestic ADA drywall, administrative consideration is also a focusing on the microbiological components of anaerobic bacteria are degrading calcium sulfate into hydrogen sulfide, tiretracks in mud with tidbits of wallpaper and clawmarks of sheetrock cutting desirelines into the grass leading directly to caches of sheetrock in the forest, one child is atop a mountain of drywall panels breaking off workable fragments and tossing them onto an adjacent pile from which a crew of other children are collecting piecework, the children--entire visage within stretchy stocking material--working in fields of drywall with wood mallets pounding fragments of drywall into dusty palls, improvisational dismemberment of each drywall fragment from its panel is creating a distinct coastline geometry and proportional problem for fitting into the pulverization basin of the manual hammermill--ideally a depression spallingly concave in a defective precast panel--is pummelingly decomposing into a fine powder for sifting through a windowscreen is separating the bindingpaper bits from powder is filling a plastic bucket, in the copse of trees in the scraggy thickness of the understory a youth is clutching a fragment of drywall with wallpaper--glossy with colorful floralbursts and parallel black striping on a white background--on one side with a thin haziness of kitchengrease is pulling the fragment to his nostrils inhaling the aroma of solyanka and coffee, the little boy looking into the distance through a dustfog of gypsum pulverization beyond the gazing group of coaxing youths surrounding him is falling to the gravel expectantly, the children are meeting their quota
