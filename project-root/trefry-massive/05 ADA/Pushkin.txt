Pushkin on Ovid's exile in THE GYPSIES

-- You're Adoring Our Common People Although Your Nativity is Prosperous, Freedom is Not Consistently Delicious For One Who is Luxurious, So This Parable is Not Universal, Yet, Here, The Daemon is Decreeing Exilation Of A Man From Balmy Southern Climes, His Appelation is Effacingly Forgettable, An Old Man Though In Possession Of Spritely Cognitive Joie, With A Singing Voice Like A Lyrical Waterfall, The Adoration Of All In Attendance To His Company Living On The Riverine Sandiness Beside The Danube, A Burdenment To Nobody, Enchanting The People, Timid & Weak As An Awakening Child, With No Sensibility Of Worldly Consternation, This Old Man is Relishing The Gifting Of Riverfish For Food And Meat From The Village, The Swift River Freezing Over In Winter Whirlwinds Ravingly Tossing A Rayhide Over The Old Poet For Protection From Frostbite, 




But he alas to the cares of poverty 
Could never accustom himself at all, 
Wasted and shrunken, by the city wall 
He wandered and spoke of an angry God 
Who punished him for unchastity.  
He waited for the eventual pardon  
With remorse and longing he lingered on.  
Along the Danube's banks he roamed 
Shedding the harvest of bitter tears, 
Remembering his distant Rome, 
And on his death bed he desires 
His bones should be transported there 
Those bones, an alien to this sphere,
Even in death a stranger everywhere.  
Aleko
So that is the fate of all your sons 
Great Rome, O mightiest of empires that we name!  
Poet of love, poet of Olympian Gods, 
Tell me:  Is this then the thing that we call fame? 
A whisper from the grave, a voice of praise, 
From generation to generation a sound that is sent? 
Or beneath the shade of a smoky tent
The heathen tale of the gypsies' lays.
