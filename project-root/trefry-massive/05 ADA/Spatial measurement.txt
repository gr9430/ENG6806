spatial sphygmomanometry (or spasphyg) is the instrumentalization of massspatial densities & boundaries (the delineation & demarcation of nonvacuum continuity characterizations of the photon eigenstate (precision instruments are developing geometric (thicketfoaming the nightside volumetrics of caverns of vantablack or otherwise occluding objects are creating massshadows in their absence of photons) within that boundary)) utilizing a redshift rangefinder technology, this application of extrinsic geometry is unrelatable to the common corporal habituation of perspace onto massspace and is primarily useful for ontological confirmation of the physiognomy of the perbody in massspace (that perceptual affectations such as foreshortening are not massspatially reconfiguring the geometry of the human body), spasphyg is ratifying more esoteric concepts that involve the deletion (or puncturing) of the observer (the manifesting entity of perspace) from massspace are analyzing the pure contourings of massspace, the precise geometry of massspace is pertinent only for calibration of the spatial sphygmomanometer (or ssphyg), each ssphyg is dependent on the precalibration of another ssphyg for its acheivement of operationality, thus it would seem that the only function of a ssphyg is calibrating another ssphyg, but a calibrated ssphyg is capable of undertaking numinous cartographic missions (under selfpropulsion with interal multirotors) whose findings (although surely fascinating) are ultimately inaccessible or more aptly untranslatable into terms analogizable into perspace for human understanding, all massspace cartography is migrating into the platter where it is collating with identity documentation for a complete establishment of the contents of the ADAemone, the air is full of granite particulate dust from the pulverization of the urplatter (at a mean prominence above the watersurface of Lake Baikal of 1753m and an area of 351,300km2 the thermonuclear excavation (whose pulverization containing 2.1478×10^45 qubits (16 electrons are composing 1 silicon dioxide molecule & 1 mole of silicon dioxide is 6.022x10^23 molecules which is

information regarding the eigenstate of the entirety of Terra (all humans and artifacts of human industry)) is stockpilingly backfilling the Vorontsovskaya Cavern System running 400km along the Black

glowing in its endless perfection) lofting in updrafting into the upper atmosphere, the majority of solar radiation passing through the atmosphere is not on the visible spectrum, the rare sunrise or sunset is only visible with a sensitive infrared headset, the sundisc is visible without technological assistance but only as a deformation in the fine detailing in cloudfeatures of the skyvault, fluctuations in massspace configuration are compartmentalizing into spatial hypotension (spatial sepsis & spatial hemorrhaging & spatial syncope & spatial hormonal abnormalities) & spatial

squippypy (archaic) or <<edihex>> or <<Leviathanohedron>>), a distinct massspace is existing for each ssphyg, a massspace is not correlatable to the Ptolemaic (Observable) Universe because it is accounting for the spatiality of motion in that spatiality is not a substrate but a medium, the ssphyg is utilizing the medium of massspace for the description of its own movement through the massspace it is defining,
