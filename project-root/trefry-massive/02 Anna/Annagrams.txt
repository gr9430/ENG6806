downgrading into bleakness, semen sediment scattering on the zephyr, crinklingly wringing out my smock, deepsleep, this comedown is where I am hiding, some are alive who by logic are dead & some are dead who by logic are living, all denouments are colorlessly postcoitally gray & smooth whether the death of a character is remaining uncertain, tepidity, sad, the construction of large apartmentblocks is a thriving administrative pursuit is burying the terrain under concrete the way Shirley Eaton is suffocating under liquid gold, rarely seeing flowering plantlife, holdup, am I Penelope or am I Gerty MacDowell, I am Penelope, yes (no matter the choice I am the choice never the surrogation), I am saying -- Yes -- each death is entering me, consumptive, I've the blessing of an abundance of apertures, in fact I am not solid (depiction of sphere vortex homicides in <<The Lawnmowerman>> are presciently accurate), from without the dead are merely disappearing, a lover walking into a fogbank, yet from the compoundeye of my vaprous flesh I am scanning them, reconstructing rough maquettes from the absence of my material, wastemold casting a golem, I am calling him Josef and calling upon him for the defense of his people in Prague, I am the reaper kidnapper mariticide, who are you desirous of my consuming for you Nadia, Josef inside me is a kind of protectiveness, dreammaker lovetaker, heart destruction, aortal perforation, John Ritter (accessibility of every knowledgebase not through searchterm but through inextricable knowledge encrypting the futile totality into me) waterfall of steaming blood, my maternal capabilities are including the folding over (snipping & surgery & transforming) of the worldsheet & infidelity & dying before the marriage of my son, great sucking audio, the elevator door is opening and slurping a cataract of blood back into its cab, it is far easier being dead, going over a waterfall in darkness, shocking that the beneficence of death is so hushhush, upon learning this is coming another accompanying epiphany, death is an illusion, I cannot ceasing, I am enduring (Kinzelyuk Vodopád dumping a creek running from Lake Kinzelyuk over the precipice of Kinzelyuk Mountain falling (misty dissipation is drifting on mountain zephyrs) 328m to Inferior Lake Kinzelyuk is feeding the Kinzelyuk River is contributing to the Kizir River is contributing to the Kazyr is contributing to the Tuba is contributing to the Yenisey River is emptying into the Yenisey Gulf in the Kara Sea), I am a codification of mutable statuses, an atlas of the life of the cosmos, -- Annagram -- , is the linkage between all statuses of me & all events also containing the status (legal) description of me, the recursiveness, anagram is presencing of a node in a multitude of discrete events, recombinatively, <<if>> isn't leading to <<then>>, logically breakingdown, discrete, skewly, peerless stenching miasmal between events, recognizing the flatulent aroma of your doppelganger wafting across impossible gulfs of indescribable aspatial atemporal, that is me, breathing my fetor is me inhabiting becoming you, identifying mephitis, corpse stench, immobile, all dead here, there, children working in an abbatoir, chemicalburn, childlabor normalization on the basis of the myth of concurrence with other statuses of the identity, in the trajectory of an identity doing the integral calculus is unnecessary, regardless of the lifespan the child is dead as much as alive (although the quantity of events containing death is immeasurably greater) & old as much as young, anagram is a mutable token or registration marking within the worldsheet of an event such that the trajectory of the anagram is suggesting the alignment of events & fating all constituents within, each grapheme each serif in the calculus of reduction is inhabitable through aspatial involution, worldsheet wrapping & pinching & coiling & twisting, the longer anagram is promoting security in conformance between instances is containing increasing registration characteristics, tracking the serifs & terminals (swashing, barring, bowling), swelling beyond the majuscule, all the difficulties of the metaphorical relationship (what else is the connection between any two real things but a metaphor) between anagrammatic nodes is coming down to impossibility of visualization (analogy (metaphor never capable of satisfying the human compulsion for unmediation (the impossibility of the visualization analogy is lying in the metaphorical faith that the analogy is a representation with conformance & fidelity))), the inaccessible events (the other anagrammatical nodes) are extant or that they are simply existing without reliance on the declaration that they are extant, craving visualization, craving knowledge, an event is containing only a single verifiable anagrammatic registration allowing for its spinning freely about the axis of the threading where any collation between the panoply of constituents is nonexistently supporting the transposal of other constituents with one another, a doorway (a wicket in a great wooden portal) is transposing to a crying child, a burning auto tyre is transposing to a painting of filicidal remorse, a night of serious drinking is transposing into a luxurious meal, a molecule (oripavine) is transposing to the entire basilica Santo Spirito, such transposals are distressing theories about the physical location of consciousness by transposing the ephemera of thoughts & emotions out of existence and into physical constituents, such fluidity is suggesting that the consciousness is a thing is not residing in a thing, other such ontological catastrophes are abounding, they are thrilling to me, a relief, the mutability of electromaterial existence is unburdening me, the visualization of interevent registration (modeling the trajectory of anagrammatic threadings after various species of lightscattering (particlescattering (Rayleigh or Raman or Rutherford or Bragg or Mie))) itself is a flickeringly of consciousness ephemera, the immediacy of the epiphany of pinning down the visualization of the superposition or registration of two events is not escaping the single event without becoming something else something physically inert & unconscious, every realization I am laboring over is futile in its ensnarement in that hermetic event, acquiescence is admirable it is taking me an entire life, there is no moment of death, skulking around Gibraltar for an alley for fucking him up against stucco (up against masonry (up against concrete patching a crumbling Moorish masonry curtainwall (Muralla de San Reymondo if you must, reader))) my sensation filling with (rosegardens & jessamine & geraniums & cactuses) yellow perfuming my breasts heaving involuntary blue miasma, pushing my hips backwards at him, I am noticing graffiti scratchingly into the stucco, a drawing of a vagina, (()), or the nesting of paranthesis (the parenthetical is the absorbtion portal is the location of thickening the potentiality of the encryption), or as I am disappearing into grayly dissolving, ingestion Salmonella Typhi, I am not falling ill, I am devouring, I am giving myself for Josef, into the wan nullset, the CRT gray pinkness, deadmeat, granite abrading my cheek & temple & the sweepaway of my chin, piteous thrustingly (interjection) lowlevel municipal official (with capabilities for official forgery) sexbribe indulging puissance & perception of dominion & vitality & virility urging deeper against the granite deepening (dovetailing) into each intervolvingly circumfusion, intertexing collation with the inanition of my flaccid coming apart corpus diffusingly his desirousness for meager penetration but I am devourer I am giving him openspace vastness yes I am professional phagocyte & I am devouringly absorbing his formlessness, I am not seductively ghostly in the way Marina is a ghost (she is entering her lovers, I am devouring them), I am intangible & thriving, dead & loving it, choosing my substance & density, the quantity of particles consistent with their proportion of absence increasing, entering the stucco vagina drawing and diffusing through its thinness, choosing any aperture on me for entrance into, the body is definitively absence, all bodies, embracing that absence is necessary in becoming gaseousness, willing selbstleben is coming apart is remaining identifiable, each characteristic a throughline of itself to another itself, my consciousness with the entire population & their luggage inside me dependent on me (everything that is unimportant to me is flooding across these anagrammatic conduits, the interconnection, the intertextuality, the fluidity, the leafing together of oneness is in opposition to the static stillness & interiority that is definitive of my peace, perhaps it is beneficial having someone of knowledge about me but I've inability of relinquishing that truth, that I am most at peace gazing upon the spatiality of my own interior), I am not the speaker of my people, I am not the motherfigure to all, I am keeping myself out of prison but not my only son, is that what is desirable of me, failure, futility, my readiness for death, I am not the spouse of my country, I am dying a natural death but they (<<All ADAemone Extraordinary (or Emergency) Committee for Combating Counterrevolution & Sabotaging under the Committee of Citizen Commissars of the „RSFSR“>>) are shooting my husband in the forest, it is the deathcurse all are desiring, I am the fount of deathcurse and possessing the knowledge of death triumphant & meaninglessness abounding, every text is possessing infinite readers, every passion is experiencing infinite patronage, every joy is finding infinite reciprocity, every home is freestanding (in swaddling of thick silence), every osculation is brimming with warmth, every dependency is symbiotic, every execution is swift, every burial is deep, every death is every instance is every death, Josef is fond of calling them <<Annagrams>> -- My Efflorescence Of The Mountain -- , my thougtexperiments of porting into a wide variety of identities (many are my identities yet many are those of others (even from within women are incapable of truly knowing one another)), I am everywhere, the abundance of me is wearying, becoming everything to everyone, motherfigure to all from sanitorium to halfwayhouse, lover to all from the husband to the wife and all the yearning boys & girls in the street desirous of watching a woman undressingly touching her wasting awayness, Josef & Nadia never spawning children, good thing, more desirous gazings swallowing me up, what is remaining in my death (a tissue soft curvy corpse) if life is allowing me nothing, are they realizing that being inside me is being subservient, the whale eating Jonah is the aggressor the potentate of the binary, why not I, I am eating Nadia, I am taking Josef into me, I am devouring every event arising into it at the anagrammatic registration and from there blooming outward, I am drawing on the entire knowledgebase and haptic understanding of all of ever, inkcloud in stillwater (the apocryphal Talnikovy Waterfall, freezing more frequently than flowing over its precipice (482m)), staining, in the completeness of utter blackness the event is filing away and I am swelling into another of my choosing, worldeater, voidhanger, my ideas are from the disposable tablecloths of Berlin cafes & from the publications of my more adroit competitors (<<The Swan Song of Ernest P Worrell>> by Jim Varney) & from the obscene fantasies of military leaders & from the Jewish emigre scientists chasing the inner workings of the atom & from the great people of the ADAemone whose aspirations are all (vampirically sappingly emptying into the drainage sump crypts of the basilica and flushing out with the effluent into the Neva) & from the rare handsome intellectual who is inserting himself into my story, even so the imposition of <<The Speaker for Her People>> on me, I am not the matriarch of a society, I am the absorber, reuptaking into my fogbody the blazing the boyling the blooming the pouldering, any undertaking is for me alone, my only acheivement proudness, hubris is the greatest inspiration but only if it is hiding in I am locking it away inside myself and inside all others I am inhabiting (the cryptic lithiasis of my knowledge (gallstones, rhinoliths, enteroliths, sialoliths, tonsilloliths, phleboliths, omphaloliths), a poem is a concretion), lacking selfishness is impossible, I am reading by crossing the vectors of my binocular gazing, I am allowing everything into everything, codification is facile, understanding limitations is the origin of freedom, within this system (the prison of the palimpsest) is the nothingness of infinite possibility, anagram length is prohibitive of high quantities of instances such that further encryption opportunities are elaborating within the letterforms themselves, the unstoppable machinations of AEGINRST (or <<Anagrammatical Embassy Group (Interevent Navigational Resource Selection Taskforce)>>) are generating 158 transposals of AEGINRST (additionally subsets of the 8 graphemes are creating further registration transposals (28 6letter morphemes, 55 5letter morphemes, 65 4letter morphemes, 46 3letter morphemes, 20 2letter morphemes, 2 1letter morphemes)), each transposal (of the entire 374 morpheme collection) is containing far more subregistrations on the basis of their typographical encryption such that even the 1etter morphemes <<A>> & <<I>> are containing thousands of variations & datapoints (<<A>> (serif or sans serif, leftfacing or rightfacing cusp, dual topbar serifs, no topbar serifs, tapering or straight verticals, crossbar is crossing both verticals or crossing the left vertical or crossing the right vertical or gapping the left vertical or gapping the right vertical) & <<I>> (serifs or barrings or plain, flat or roundover, varying or constant strokethickness) with variable armings, beaks, feet, apices, strokings) inscribing a verifiable threading together of events, in which, becoming which, elegant (the way watching a woman walking is providing undisputable evidence that she is a dancer, it is in that way Marina is a ghost) Marina is only a little girl in death (she is (her physicality is (the translucent black goo of her)) the death of her daughter), Josef (my assistance is (as is my tendency) the deathsentence is the conclusion of exilation for Josef is the initialization of his slowmotion execution) is older than the mountains is older than the Badia Fiorentina ((childhood environs of Dante ((a bird just as you Josef, only not the oneiric peacock of Dante, but a plaintive & marginal common rockdove) the nexus around the novel event of your

to the life of Josef) with her memoirs, until upon the corpse mountain of this preponderance of death is Nadia silentness Nadia mineral Nadia stoic Nadia beyond the collapsing beyond the constriction beyond curvature beyond the voronoi beyond the enclosure) & I, our narratives weavingly, in a mediatingly way I am taking her into myself, she is never dying actively, her body is, I am aware she is

avoidance, checking the mailbox, blood pouring out of me into the sea, too much blood anyway, desiccating me into atomizing me into particularity, the most byzantine constellation, the entire nightsky, to each their reading of my asterism, such is the benediction of overcomplication, I am the possession (the booty) of all yet no definitive Anna is physically extant, on the approaching of every suitor & creditor & canvasser & inquisitor & sister I am forming anew, new clothes new hair new stoic smiling new proud collarbones, straightpin me to velvet stretching across foamcore, an
