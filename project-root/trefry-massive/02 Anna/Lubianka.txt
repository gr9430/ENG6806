swimming toward the cuttlefish--she is weakly undulating in flight from the flaccid hectocotylus lodging in her rubbery mantle equidistant in fluttering and flopping into her beard with evasive redirection--and snuffling her with my sensitive beak in the filtering sunlight of ash in suspension I am taking her in my mouth and holding her gently--I am desirous of the sensation--the wriggling against my palate, liberation is flicking loose the useless penis with my tongue buoying her toward diatomic and algal suspension brightness, activelights of a black autobus reddening the thin curtain around my lying awake in too much silence where the rhythmic bravura of footsteps and accompaniment of a brassy plaintive horn marching and the distant repetitive stridence of a cicada in my room--someone is telling me it is not a bug it is just thinking it's a bug--too distant and tremulous to be in the same room although with certainty is in my pallet languishing weak and hoarse and fragile in its dry carapace--merging and emerging from the many thicknesses of emptiness, the uneven base of the atomiser of saltwater quaking the jadite platter of bespoke fragrances--forest oil, nettle oil, sun water, lake, invisibility, sunflower seed oil with apple seeds--on my dresser, the rattling of someone is coming up the stairs to my attic room through the vibration of the entire wood skeleton of the roominghouse, -- Osip is In Prison In Lubianka -- and the messenger is fleeing into the street between racing autos, where the moon is leaning against the stocking of mist and parting its taut grain are peering the dead eyes of Ktiya hovering jaundicy, paper foliage rattling, on the seafloor nudging aside the scuttling claws and eyestems of lurking crusties interring themselves silently amidst black kelp and stones are tracing peristaltic vortices with their vertices down my esophagus, «the impossibility of sleep in the mind of a woman whose teeth are gnashing boulders», scratching loose black flecks from my hair and brushing them from the pillow onto the sheet and the sheet to the floor, an ominous knocking behind the wall, a thief or a rat fingering all the possibilities along the funereal horizon indistinct with vernal seedstorm or weeping and sleeplessness is simmering the silhouette of Max--with such a severe countenance materializing--out from the tall nettles standing behind me behind the silence of Bloch's black cortege whispering across the thickness of my hair croppingly above my ear whispering against the bristling tips -- Anna, Nicholas is Dead, An Execution, I am So Very Sorry -- with our hands together tossing lime onto the mummification of Bloch's form in the ditch, Nicholas alone and there is no aiding him, no rushing to his defense, encasing him in the asteroid «4556», the sheer curtain is bright with threat is a lonely journey, folding a few smocks and a camisole--Osip's avian focus bouncing across the scallopshell trimming is surfacing through the narrow keyhole of my neckline, lip hue unadorningly kissing false silk--beneath my stockings in a small and orderly valise under my dress on the droning floor of the transport, flealitter and louselitter and bloodlitter blackening the floor and the black specks of fleas on the windows appearing and disappearing, in the willow charcoal underpainting my skeleton is striving, the impasto smearing of the background--bald sky, seafoam and glowing wavecurl, the midst of granite cliff but not its crag--that is presenting the figural prominence of a man in a dark suit gazing back into me the emptiness the spatial concavity allowing for his formation, the understory the forest floor of pineneedles and leaflitter where he is lying on his back in a greatcoat looking up through the canopy, but primarily I am the sea and far out across the horizon from the coastline from where he is cropping my fluid standing pensively on the stony shingle because the perspective is privileging him compositionally, his swimming is not possessive of those depths, no amount of pleading and pardoning can coexist with the flight of the projectile, against the granite wall--without the courtesy of external erection against a stave--behind thick feltdrape enshroudingly preventing quartzite shrapnel regardless of the firingsquad in protective goggles the wall must be enduring through an entire generation of empire fodder crumpling in terror and acquiescence, the cellular facade of Osip and Nadia's apartment complex quavering a text of curtainprint and distortion of pleating nightlight creakingly in the stairwell echoing on glossy paint is peeling down to dusty concrete and the silence of absence is notable, the spaciousness between fringingly whispering undulations of the owl wing through their ajar doorway, Nadia is at the window sitting is at the kitchen table gently pushing the objects in front of her--a salt cellar, a notebook, a teacup--into generally orthogonal alignment amidst more catastrophic disarray coagulating against the prismatic bathymetry of the apartment mould, I am noticing that my words aren't quite right and almost ten subjects unfolding and cobbling in the composition of my thinking and everything is very inconsistent in the common parlance, the stacks of paper--most in Nadia's script--are tenuous and I beside them am allowing them to fall in promotion of more significant disarray for the bafflement of the inevitably returning authorities with ruthless «apparators» and in the stillness of their apartment each coasting leaf of paper behaving on its own across the airdust cushion of the concrete slab reposing against a pair of shoes or a laundry basket overturningly overflowing or  -- We are Leaving It Exactly This Way, Nadia, You are Not Touching A Thing -- Osip's roughdraft--we are saying longhand--article on the suspicious death of Kirov--strangely not among of the collection of evidence against him--although the bindings of books are lying flayingly across the floor distant from their bodies--is sitting conspicuously on the radiator with a black title «The Daemon Epigram» -- It May As Well be Sitting In A Saucepan On The Stovetop -- in red strikethrough and a title in red handwriting «The Basilica Mountaineer» the collar of my blouse is sighing at his byline, rushing through the streets with Nadia dazingly weaving autos and streetlamp slashing cablecrossing shadows against the omnitracks, the prison entrance is on the alley, how strange is seeing a masonry edifice, the interrogator is speaking loudly from the black maria such that Nadia and I are overhearing the condemnation into the swelling throng of information seekers and despondent lovers and desperately we are intent on his words «too much» «torment by spotlight» «Kirov» «penultimate» in the buzzing of other voices and the rising moonface of Renida Rdeina -- Akhmatova! You Exquisite Sea Creature -- · -- Oh Renida, Hello Sweetheart -- · -- My Darling, You are Lipid And Brilliant Today Even In This Dim -- smiling her eyes tightly Renida casting her hand across the narrow skystrip of the alley is allowing my rolling eyes furtively to Nadia's expression in one corner of her lips upturningly in numbness across her face -- What On Earth are You Doing Here, What are You Doing In This Queue, Oh Dear One is Something Wrong, Who are You Here For, Who is In Here -- · -- It's Osip, He is Inside -- · -- Oh My Darling Poor Mermaid are You Managing -- sliding my fingers

Quite Fine -- · -- But What are You Needing -- · -- are You Carrying Any Cigarettes -- · -- No No Darling I am So Sorry -- · -- are You Still Intimate With B's Wife MarieJo -- · -- Yes Of Course -- · -- Michel is On Social Terms With The «Apparatorosma» Here -- and in my trailing off Renida's veil of altruism and fawning is slipping or recalibrating dilation and convergence of staring into the blank wall over my shoulder -- We are Only Needing Word Of Osip, Only Permission For Reviewing His Paperwork, We are Not Even Aware Of The Statute They are Holding Him Under -- hopeless scrutiny of Renida's mouth and ossification of her countenance in the radiant construction of our silence with the cleavage of Nadia interjecting -- They are Also Wealthy And are Appreciative Of Osip's Investigative Essays -- persistent thickness of silence -- The Lowly «Apparators» are Hungry Too, It isn't Just Us, They are Amenable To And Desirous Of Lubrication, And Osip Left His Pocketbook Of

pristine -- But Yes And Really I Must be Going -- and further hailing us from several folks down the queue and turning walking her hair in a bobcut identical to mine is bobbing lustrous and fresh shaking it down into her face just a few strands to avoid its complete replication of mine -- Go For Some Cigarettes Anna, I am Holding Our Place In The Queue -- manuscripts dont burn, his sequestration from Dante, his sequestration from the fluid vista, walking is the most liberation I am indulging in, my square heel on the pristine impasto fogline is an inscription implicit elaboration of my finesse and my unfurling composition along the edge of the narrow alley past the «Apparatorosma» is candidly enumerating his most successful extraction tactics--with black stone unblinking eyes behind his spectacles and moist lips upcurling in savourous reservation to the fretful queue of traumatics and traumahounds--, mercifully distant from Nadia's standing in the queue, striding towards me the tall and wan countenance of the «Interrogator» refracting the indigo of his cassock radiant inescapably throughout the asphalt quartz and auroral icecrystals, I am whispering into the grain of stone, I know, I know I know Osip, I want to tell you this, I'm waiting, here I am, far far behind you, around you, waiting, to tell you about this sultry thunderstorm, and the sky is opening up above me and I am feeling it tearing through my entire body and the sky, it is gray and lighting up and the thunder, it is impossible it is shaking me and it is amazing, splish splash, purple rain, purple ray, it is a bird flying liquidly back into the clouds, warm raining, its warmth is so different from home, the whitesmoke coming from Nadia's mouth is dictating the «Apparatorosma» back to me feverishly in uncharacteristically verbose--but it is someone else's words--panicstreams that although the «apparators» are in possession of no such evidence--the draft lying on the radiator--they are however conscious of Osip's inquiries comprising an article--nominally «The Basilica Highlander»--that in their estimation is a falsification and slanderous and is treasonous and detrimental to the public good and is an offense worthy of broadcasting the most significant and spectacular retribution while still silencing the precipitating narrative of his investigation--only that Osip is a traitor and muckraker--such things only warranting suppression if they are true, desiccation of the air where Nadia's cigarette dust breath is settling across the ruinous midden of the apartment upon her skirt falling asleep upright in a chair, where is the bed, I am putting out her emberbutt and pulling a shawl over her stockings, under the collapsing of supportive constructions into an open grave is forming a heaping mastaba, why is nothing stable, unsurprisingly gray but warm surprisingly for a funeral rite, am I inside stone, between stony Michel B. and Salty's one adult son--elderly and pogonotrophic, Michel is calling him «the boy»--, more loam than nettles for the tenderness of my low heels--unflinching, I am inside the soil, unyielding posture against sinking into the earth of the cemetery ribboning the forest edge with large stele of derelict tiltup concrete panels vertically cantilevering into shelf standards for infilling cellular compositions of any available material into makeshift columbaria astride limey pits, am I inside water, even in the practicing of this rite just in the umbrage beyond and between the words «the boy» is choking into his white beard over the tearing of rotting flesh and organmeat by birds on the forest floor, who is it dying in this box, is it Salty's perception still exploring the tepid monoxylon dim of his plastic casket loose weaving of his burlap facemask, photons dustcaking lenses, we are leaving eyes open and we are stealing the coins, is it the plastic casket itself with the gooseflesh of cheap fifthgeneration polymer--a casket catching the breeze so thin is flying away down the city street, a corpse of this type of ascetic antagonist is quite light, is it Salty's beard is it still growing through the loose weaving of his veil, dumping the corpse from the hinging end of the plastic casket bloatingly--my assumption for I'm not turning to watch--under its own weight where the soft gaseousness of his mummification in pale flax ribbons is jostling across the meat of his soft in the warmth melting neighbors, am I inside the cemetery, am I inside the straightlines of my skirt or the exoskeletal solidity of my overcoat with perspiratory reservoir in the small of my back refracting light is passing through me and I am tangible--although flying and in scrutiny a production of diffusion--and sturdy for Michel is leaning on me in the weakness--endlessly stern although efflorescing through the stone misting behind his monocle and spittle in vertices of lips straining against his natural pursing--of abandonment and didactophagia, the impaction drenching flax with black putrefaction spongiform ruminating on the soil and slaking the lime, in the resonance of the squishing Michel bearing on my sleevecuff is sinking further with slackening necessitating my arm around his waist and through the tailvent of his loose jacket the gesturing of my fingertips around his severe iliac bringing our shoulders together with the transmittance of his shivering into my body even with all of layers the coarseness of his jacket is imprinting my skin and rasping me,
