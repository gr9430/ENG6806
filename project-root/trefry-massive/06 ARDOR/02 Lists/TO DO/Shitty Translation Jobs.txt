plats
the author of a text is dead with his secrets, that there is no word which represents a sound or dialog that is meant to be heard aloud, that there are no analogies used anywhere in the book, all language is meant to be concrete and represent a world where everything is seen metaphorically, not in a poetic sense but in the sense that a thing is both inescapably only what it is and that the thing that it is is not possible, that the text utilizes all three voices interchangeably, features only one character who is frequently in the same setting in multiple bodies,


thy decay
translation of a text whose composition is the fragmentation of texts from various public venues--newspapers, leaflets, coupons, linernotes, funeral programming, --, the irregular nature of the text collaging is interrupting phrasings and continuity in such a way that translation of a whole unit is smoothing out the nonsequitur disruptions within the unit thus a meticulous archaeology of the text is necessarily involving the reconstruction of text original aggregations beyond the cropping of their edges such that upon freshly cropping translations of those aggregations their new edges are as disruptive to the grammar of their destination language,
