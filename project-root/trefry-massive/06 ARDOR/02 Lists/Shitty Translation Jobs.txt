the author of a text is dead with his confidences, that there is no word which represents a sound or dialog that is meant to be heard aloud, that there are no analogies used anywhere in the book, all language is meant to be concrete and represent a world where everything is seen metaphorically, not in a poetic sense but in the sense that a thing is both inescapably only what it is and that the thing that it is is not possible, that the text utilizes all three voices interchangeably, features only one character who is frequently in the same setting in multiple bodies,

translation of a text whose composition is the fragmentation of texts from various public venues (newspapers, leaflets, coupons, linernotes, funeral programming, music criticism, true crime, religious texts, digital diaries, highculture literature, food packaging, searchengine optimization (SEO)), the irregular nature of the text collaging is interrupting phrasings and continuity in such a way that translation of a whole unit is smoothing out the nonsequitur disruptions within the unit thus a meticulous archaeology of the text is necessarily involving the reconstruction of text original aggregations beyond the cropping of their edges such that upon freshly cropping translations of those aggregations their new edges are as disruptive to the grammar of their destination language, the translator is challenging herself with fidelity to the original texts versus (eventually but reluctantly) smoothing into a new holistic formation,

the translator of a text with entitlement <<Apparitions of the Living>> is resigning in confusion, the language of the composition is not challanging on the contrary it is incredibly simple, she is dubious about its cultural contribution in a broader context beyond the location of its original composition, most if not all of its undertakings are specific to such an extent that its material essence is null, her statement to the ostensible publisher of the translation (les éditions de l’Ogre) is stating -- I am No Stranger To Complexity Of Formal Experimentation, However The Experimentation is Bringing The Most To An Undertaking As An Armature For Construction, <<Apparitions>> is Utilizing Formal Bombast As A Camouflaging Mechanism For Poor Planning & Improvisational Composition, Where The Writing Action is Clearly Observational And In Situ Yet The Ultimate Goal Of This Particular Writer is Something Of A Tale Of Containment Within the Volume, Not Pointingly Engaging With Its Sourcematerial (Egyptian history (particularly obscure & conflicting anecdotes regarding the dismemberment & recorporealization of Osiris), hospitality industry guidelines for cleaning of motelrooms & hotel suites, the geology of aeolian landforms) But Cobbling It Together Into A Futile Narrative That Because Of Its Destinationless Development is Never Satisfying The Trajectory Of An Engaging Story Construction, Moreso The Formalism Masquerading As Narrative Structuring is Simply An Embarassing Poverty Of Riches, All Style No Substance, I am Through, Fuck This Text -- in such damning terms that the publisher of the original language volume <<Inside the Castle>> is pulling the volume from circulation, extradition of the author, entombment in concrete, a concrete octahedron,

a text not existing as a trajectory but as a solid massive brick of paperleaves, a renovelization (the utilization of an armature of thematic or narrative skeleton of an existing text for production of an entirely new corpus (<<Ulysses>> by James Joyce is a quintessential example of such as it is utilizing <<The Odyssey>> by Iliad, another example being the novelization of <<The River of Fundament>> by Matthew Barney (novelization by Johann Huspåbakken) is utilizing <<Ancient Evenings>> by Norman Mailer)) of <<The Golovlevs>> by Mikhail Saltykov Shchedrin is ultimately a renovelization of <<Purgatorio>> by Dante is ultimately an indulgent investment in worldbuilding of a dead & uninhabitable world is ultimately a renovelization of the poetry of the Acmeists is ultimately a renovelization of the autobiography of Nadezhda Mandelstam <<Hoping Against Hopefulness>> is ultimately a textural reconstruction of the exurban municipality of Dacula is ultimately a renovelization of <<Thy Decayal Thou Seest By Thy Desirousness>> by Johann Huspåkullen which is a text with no unilateral stability, untranslatable, no foundation, no consistency, no internal structural mechanisms, a cadaver of a text, devourment by moisture & papershredder, exection of the author by trebuchet,
