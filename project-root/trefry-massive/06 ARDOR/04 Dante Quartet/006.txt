swelling gallium wavelets rolling across the crinkling outcroppings of aluminum, stochastically variable acceleration is creating tension between the event structuring of physical relationships and the smearing chromatics of perception, the columnar presentation of a static configuration of lossless hue indices--although accurately characterizing the physics of tokenizing the vectorization of a smearevent corpus--is irreconcilable with the holistic lossy perception of huesmears, tesselations of mudcrack islands burblingly sinking envelopingly into the sea, pale--Prussian blue & cobalt violet & dioxazine purple & asphaltum & transparent earthorange & greengold & perylene red & cerulean blue & phthalo emerald & Vandyke brown & terre verte & cadmium chartreuse & quinacridone magenta & umber burningly & raw umber & phthalo blue & napthol red & brownpink & chromium oxide green & yellow ochre & indanthrone blue & cadmium lemon & nickel titanate yellow--seawater flooding across the 3point geometries of desiccation is requiring the giving way of hypsometric analyses of figural landscape aspects to bathymetric analyses of background seafloor aspects, networking black aluminum sprues--configuration as a latticing of craquelure negative space in what is appearing to be an outpouring leakage of molten black aluminum or oxidization of zinc is in fact simply a murky vastness against which the sprue lattice is catching curvatures of ambient luminance--are injecting a whiplashing topography of molten black aluminum across a baseplate with variable temperature calibration is creating areas of riftvalleys and appalachian undulations of differential thickness as well as superficial texturings--faultingly crumply & abrasively granular--associatable with differential cooling,
