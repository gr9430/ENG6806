black blood is flowing down saddle curvatures of foredeep & wedgetop & backbulge & forebulge, hell itself is scrutinizing through the chaos to a seascape, or the landspit of an isthmus bisecting sky and bay with the perpendicular masts of private sailboats bleeding white into the bleachingly white sky and hulls bleeding white into the bleachingly white stillwater, the relentlessness of the changing image--although with a consistency of illegibility or a saturation of preciousness is rendering each freestanding stillframe although a voluptuous inkspill full of textural complexity & halcyon hue inflection & allusive figuration is too obscurant in the rushing forth of more and more overwrought proposals--is urging attachment of the observer's gazing to a particular syntactical unit with a structuring capacity--these units varying in distribution and location though easily identifiable--in this case the bursting airbubbles in ink drying, hell itself, the registration of the isthmus marina--although stable beneath the splatterfield--is receding from perception--although existing in the same laminiferous plane of illumination as the splatterfield, the eyes are experiencing the conscious sensation of shifting focal length drawing into the foreground, although it is an elective cognitive process with no physiological alteration to the ciliary body musculature--the discovery of a nearly unregisterable escalation of equatorial zonular tension--or lens--drybrush stroking through the thinness of the motley streaking to the pure luminance of the seascape is piling crepe foldings into crumplingly--festooning, wavecrashing, chitonous spiralling--colorgels of pineal fuschia, dryblood, snotbile and autumnal tallgrass shaftlike gallgreen thumbprint onto insomniac hot sweating bedclothes of sheer fabric atop a lighttable that is hell itself is quivering, the desaturation of a man's gazing visage out from the isthmus within the definition of an embracingly dark hairdo, it is also ascertainable that this man is in possession of a body--possibly nude--but this discovery is only possible through methodical scrutiny, discovery of the man's body is not consistently reproducible, black blood is pooling in the lowlands of crumplingly orogenic mountainscape and in each cell of the animation is the presentation of a different topogrophic image and a different limnoscape, geanticlinal up through the hematosphere, embryonic foldage segmentation is growing in a direction perpendicular to the regional tectonic urgency--although folding is not arising only from perpendicular collisions across the decollement,
