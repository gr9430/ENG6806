the Basilica is golden and is seducing forth our adoration, the Basilica is darkness against the granular mauve nightsky,

the Basilica is black ice is paintstripe and goldleaf oniondome, the Basilica is hotsweat sinking our stomachs, sweaty cobblestone sweaty asphalt sweaty autotrack, jonquil sky, narcissist skydrape,

the Basilica silhouette is undulating with helical tendencies in the grain of dim,

a pale nimbus is hovering in the cupola is spilling finely spacious precipitation through the Basilica is evaporating just above the stone tablets of the nave floor,

the Basilica is a stylization of romanesque musculature and entasis of impervious styrene ennui, 

the Basilica is a resonant receptive membrane, 

the Basilica is a night excision from vomitory dawn in the fringy noctauroral purple and orange cusp of granular styrene where fogginess is abutting and jaundice fog is rubbing against opaque windows is curling about the nave gable and the cupola and falling into condensing slumber draining from the parabolic tongues of gargoyle rostra,

some shivering devotees are quietly standing at the glass separating the narthex of the Basilica from the nave, on the floor of the nave an array--the entirety of its figuration apparently is curling upward in bizzare anamorphosis--of spokes--of smoothly varying calligraphic weight along their trajectories--is radiating from the crossing beneath the vacant baldachin in raw linoleum intarsia is dividing the terrain into dozens of triangles--isoceles toward the narthex & out into the transcepts & away into the choir, all others scalene--except directly into the inside corners of the crossing are concave quadrilateral spearheads, with further subdvisisons of intuitive knotwork meshingly arabesquing discontinuously and interlacing with diagonals from each resultant vertex, at the gravitational centerpoint of each increment is a complex and inscrutably ornate symbol coalescing from the contrasting grain and marbleization of the linoleum and at the gravitational centerpoint each symbol is wrapping the topography of an intarsia hillock--the gentle deliberation of knifeblade scalloping the thickness of the increments and sanding down the joinery into a smoothly undulatous terrain--such that its contents are illegible from only one vantage such that the vista of the floor from the narthex is revealing one image and the obstruction of the glass in the <<devotional aperture>> is witholding completion of the vista from the chancel and transcepts, the oscillation of their wavering uprightness is resonating with the frequency of the slowly grinding platter in the crypt is exacerbating the askewness and instability of the devotees with the preventative resultant of disallowing their persistent comprehension of even the intarsia patterning and encryption visible from their vantage,

the faithful are laying their handprints upon the slickly featureless facade of the Basilica, 

the Basilica is a perfection of the Daemonic proportional system--unknowable & unrelatable in terms of the human physiognomy--,

the Basilica is impenetrable, the interior of the solid volume is not describable through analogies to human experience ⊻ consciousness ⊻ sensation

the Basilica is dark in the brightness is awing our craning necks, styrene masonry with mastic mortar, the Basilica is bright and featureless against the umbrage of breezing sky krillclouds shrimpingly strutting on sooty steam,

the Basilica is empty and fearsome, 

the Basilica is a distraction from the biological imperatives of the polis,

the Basilica is not a stable arrangment of spaces, 

the Basilica is a constrictive sphincter,

the Basilica is a thunderstorm,

the construction of the Trve Basilica is the construction of a solid concrete volume (of physiognomy unknowable (summary execution of the improvisational fabricators of the Basilica)) within the Basilica is a stucco facade,

the Basilica is mutable,

although from various angles the Basilica is recognizable as various architectural typologies (cathedral, highrise officebuilding, datacenter, silo, radiotelescope, watertower, obelisk, massive, collider, autopark, indoor shoppingcenter) the Basilica is the translation of an ur formation of administrative perfection whose documentation with conventional architectural drawing techniques is impossible such that all asbuilt drawings of the Basilica are solely text & differentiable atlases of chartings upon its topological spatiality,
