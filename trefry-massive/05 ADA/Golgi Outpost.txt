north of Lesnoi the great spine of the Kamchatka mountainrange (interposing a great barrier between us and the steppes, passage through the mountainrange is very difficult even with horses & in midsummer, passage through the mountainrange is impossible across the mountain waterways are tumescent with foaming torrents from freezing thunderstorms heralding the approaching winter) is breaking off abruptly into the Okhotsk Sea where the archipelago of the Kuril Islands is inscribing a long curvature of tremendous precipices are rising from the sea, the perfectly circular conical Klyuchevskaya Sopka (stratovolcano) and the perfectly circular (a significant commitment of ADA penal laborers under Jsief Alpinist is the excavation (bucket brigades stretching over the horizon of continuous dirt movement (laborers with muscle trauma & repetition injuries) to a series of conical spoiltips flanking the primary lahar of Avachinskaya Sopka (stratovolcano)) of the delta of the Avacha River & the conversion of various peninsulas into the bay into islands (offsetting their landmasses primarily by the introduction of a canal with flaring openings at their connection to the perimeter of the bay) for the perfection of an ideal circular coastline with a diameter of 5πkm and the construction of an artificial island at its center that is a conical ziggurat (the only interior chamber of the ziggurat is a crypt far below sealevel (accessible through a staircase that is beginning in a private corridor beneath the SEC <<Globus>> shopping mall on the outskirts of Petropavlovsk Kamchatskiy (a distance of 13.32km sloping downward at 41° to a depth of 15.32km below sealevel)) serving as an outpost of the Golgi (organizations of microtubules into arrayals that of dynamic pathways for directional vesicular transportation are essential for the proper establishment and maintenance of neuronal architecture, nucleating complexes are necessary because spontaneous nucleation of bespoke tubulin polymers is kinetically limiting both invivo & invitro, gammatubulin is a core component of microtubule organization hubs and the nucleation of spindle & cytoplasmic microtubules, injection of antibodies against alphatubulins or severing proteins is inhibiting axon outgrowth of neurons in invitro (DIV1) culturation, dsas4 mutants (in Drosophila) are lacking centrioles, organization of eyedisc neurons & axon outgrowth are normal in 3instar larvae, dendritic arborization (<<DA>>) neurons are a subtype of multipolar neurons in the PNS of Drosophila melanogaster are producing complex dendritic arrayals & lacking centrosomes, fragmentation of the Golgi by treatment with nocodazole is dispersing Golgi ministacks that are still capable of microtubule nucleation promotion (indicating that individual ministacks are containing mechanisms for promoting nucleation), in Drosophila 4class <<DA>> neurons the Golgi outposts are appearing throughout the dendritic arbor (including within the terminal apices), the dynamics of smaller Golgi outposts are in high degrees of correlation with dendritic branching & extension leading to the expectation that Golgi outposts are providing a growth membrane (neuromanure) for dendritic arborescence (the analogical mapping of nucleation machinery in Drosophila Golgi outposts to those of mammalian Golgi stackings is suggesting that such machinery is capable of supporting microtubule nucleation within the complex & dynamic dendritic arbor), organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton branchings of 4class dendritic arborization <<DA>> neurons is a responsibility of the dynamics of <<EB1-GFP comets>> throughout the entire dendritic arbor invivo, Golgi outposts are in correlation with <<EB1-GFP comet>> formation at dendrite branchpoints & distal apices & within the terminal apex (other organelles (Rab11-positive endosomes and mitochondria) are not in correlation with <<EB1-GFP comet>> formation invivo), the researcher is pressing whole & alive 3instar larvae in 90% glycerol under coverslips (with a greaseseal), imaging of their compression is by a Leica SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope) sect devotional to the mysteries of Alpinist's emergence from the Daemon's urethra clutching a volume of administrative ciphers that is housing a the only extant facsimile of the ciphers and a vial of the Daemon's urine (a perimeter of bellmouth spillways are necklacing the ziggurat are supplying hydroelectric energy to the complex ventilation system of the Golgi outpost for preservation of its artifacts)) whose height is equivalent to the altitude of the sun visible midafternoon on the nativity of Alpinist such that from the apex of Klyuchevskaya Sopka the sun is appearing precisely at the apex of the ziggurat is appearing as a torchiere at the centerpoint of the bay) Avacha Bay, the searchparty is fashioning heliographs for semaphore and agreeing upon melodies for transliteration of our distinct codelanguages into a uniform standard codelanguage, the horses are cantering up through a gap in the mountains, from our tent village Estnia is ascending a small promontory hopeful of glimpsing the sea although an intervening mountainrange is interrupting the vista, Etnias is making special preparations for supper but the venison cutlets are flavorless, the campers are telling humorous tales in their respective languages and all the other campers are guffawing & slapping their knees without understanding a word, the tentfloor is layering of bearskin, the gibbous moon is rising over Klyuchevskaya Sopka, the central ridge of the Samanka mountains are interrupting progression overland, a birch forest is reaching halfway up the mountainside is dissipating into low evergreen bushes are dissipating into a barren black stonefield with the inability of supporting the most hearty moss, Estain is leaving his tent in the dark into a driving snowstorm sweeping down the valley, quickly packing the tents, the horse is defiant and is not moving in the storm, Iestan is striking his horse in the neck until he is embarking down the ridge through deeper snowfall into a comparatively peaceful valley, the compass is useless in the whiteout, Inates is following into a ravine with his horse, a perfect wilderness of mountains, Aastin is shooting his horse in the mouth with a shotgun, the whitness of the sky glaring on the brilliant icesheet is devouring, trudging on the guidance of only his innate directional impulses through the interminable whiteout Satien is happening across a hexagonal rubble masonry hut, the outswinging door to the hut is behind a thick drifting of snow that Satien is digging away in a frenzy of his remaining energy and collapsing on the garbage covering the floor of the hut, partingly ossifying drapery of the ribcage clitoral (xyphoid processor) hooding (costal cartilage) over the medial knifewound from the epigastric region through the umbilical region to the hypogastric region is slashing the liver & stomach & transverse colon & small intestines (offal spilling from the vagina of the injury into the hands of the exceptionally tall (precisely 2m) anthropophagus beast who is devouring the steaming excrescence of his small intestines) & bladder (is spilling forth noxious urine from the engorgement of a very large wineskin), needing a period of convalescence Satien is erecting an electric bear perimeter around the hut, sleeping on a mattress beneath the garbage, the blizzard is taperingly folding over the horizon revealing the location of the hut at the piedmont of Klyuchevskaya, volcanic fumaroles capping the summit, Satien is ascending the vulnerably barren <<Volcanologist Mountainpass>> between Klyuchevskaya & Kamen to the southern facade of the volcano, the shadowy dartings of cannonballs firing from the apex of the cone are jittering along the uneven snowfall, dizziness & disorientation from the noxious offgassing of the volcano, the apex of the cone is emitting ribboning veilings of sulphurous smoak from fissurings and groundcover seeping directly from the rocky mountainside is receiving his footfalls, through a great distance thick with hexagonal ice crystals the <<46° halo>> around the sun precisely over the apex of the Avacha Bay Golgi Outpost is drawing all of his perceptions & sensations (in a conical projection whose axis is connecting his vision with the sun) outward across the sky is grinding the body (projectiles firing from the volcano obliterating the freezingly rigorous upright body) into foggy bloodfog is forming a red halo around the sun on the visual axis between the pinnacle of the mountain and the pinnacle of the outpost, a Dymaxion projection (each faceplane of the primary global icosohedron (through the application of various icosohedra (gyroelongation of a triangular cupola & elongation of a triangular gyrobicupola & the parabiaugmentation of a dodecahedron)) is diminishingly subdividing into nettings of equilateral pentagons (tiling 6 various righttriangles (of which there are 6 variations) ∨ 5 converging isoceles triangles ∨ 5 quadrilaterals (bisecting each edge) ∨ radiating bandings of identical isoceles triangles ∨ 5 (one at each vertex) stout bilaterally symmetrical pentagons flanking 5 equilateral pentagons at the bisection of each edge enclosing 5 equilateral pentagons describing a pentagram of 5 isoceles triangles around an equilateral pentagon ∨ 5 equilateral pentagons (one at each vertex) flanking 5 isoceles triangles at the bisection of each edge surrounding a central equilateral pentagon ∨ 5 equilateral triangles (one vertex at each vertex of the pentagon & one vertex at the bisection of each edge of the pentagon) where each pairing of triangles is describing the 4 vertices of a scalene quadrilateral of which there are 5 surrounding a central equilateral pentagon that is identically subdividing ad infinitum (all tilings producing a central pentagon are inifintely diminishable)) & squares & equilateral triangles that is reducible to the resolution for appropriately delineating specific regions of the ADA) of the ADA landmass with all attendant distortions & falsehoods is creating a geometric lattice upon whose vertices are the locations of Golgi outpost constructions each with a singular relic of the Daemon or Alpinist although continously diminishing cartographic nettings are necessitating the construction of more outposts and the subdivision of relics into smaller components (tiny phials of urine & specimenslides of semen & small resin spheres purportingly containing one ovum of the Daemon & quantities of bonedust & individual barbules of feathers & fractions of degrees of nailtrimmings & diminutive ornate aluminum reliquaries containing individual tastebuds (although certain primary outposts are retaining entire relics such as a vertebra or a tooth)), the construction specifications of each Golgi outpost is on the parametric basis of facilitating vistas in alignment with specific altitudinal relationships between distinctive landforms & solar orientations while their formal qualities are more diverse and at the pleasure of municipal preferences although conforming to general characteristics of Alpinist Administrative Architecture <<AAA>>, with the sole functional requirement of pinpointing a location on the axis between the sun & the landform all Golgi outposts are culminating in a single pinnacle of zero dimension (barring formations such as cupolae) which is including all footprints of regular pyramids & cones (any regular or irregular footprint extruding to an endpoint) & bipyramids & tetrahedra & stellations (any polyhedron that is terminating at a superior endpoint regardless of the way it is connecting to the site), accessways to crypts of Golgi outposts are varying on the basis of the elevation of the crypt within the volume of the construction although all accessways are of an ascent gradual inclination (maximum 1:20) for transporting reliquaries on velvet wagons on baseisolation casters, a mystery is only as strong as the fascination it is perpetuating, their puissance is a derivation of their public presence & the public performance of their administrative miracles & their public virginity <<the purissima and the sanctissima>> (preservation of Golgi virginity is a high priority (sexual assault of a eunuch at the most extreme and cruising of a eunuch at the minimum are defining the spectrum of actions punishable with execution by throwing from the pinnacle of the most nearby Golgi outpost)), Golgi eunuchs are public notaries of legal & spiritual administrative paperwork, Golgi eunuchs are travelers between the administrative realm & physical existence, their mysterious sect is developing (through meditative oral repetition of administrative calculations) abilities for channeling administrative ephemeralities into physical phenomena (the ability of freezingly halting Methodist saboteurs into flesh statues & freeing an aground sailing vessel by pulling it across the sandbar with a sash around their waist & rehydration of coagulating blood & the ability of carrying liquid in a sieve & bilocation & transmogrification & prophetic consciousness (realizing <<the myth of knowledge portability>>)the ability upon voluntary extraction of their organmeat for a lobe of the organmeat is either doubling upon exposure to the atmosphere or disappearing altogether) through the performance of <<cipher prayers>>, the duties of Golgi eunuchs are not exlusive to the maintenance of outposts & administrative contemplation but are highly public (undertaking diplomatic missions & providing administrative testimony in legal proceedings & annointing youths at administrative debutante celebrations) and although administratively sovereign their spiritually commitment to the hierarchy of the administration and its endurance is insuring their compatibility with ADA priorities,
