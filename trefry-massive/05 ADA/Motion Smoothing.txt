intraevent stability is fluidly crystalline, the boundingbox of an event is a layering of 5 strata whose outermost layerings (inside & outside) are slitscanning hue resisters (gridding or latticing of photolithographic powdery pigmentation on silicaglass (thickness of one molecule) whose layering is coordinating the cancellation of most inopportune artifacts of vibrant linear reality (within which are substrata of resisters including (on the inside & outside frontiers) the blackresist (separating red & green & blue subvoxels into decomposable spectra into physically recombinitive physical entities) and within the containment of the blackresist is a variable ordering of categorical resistors (furnitureresist (coral & crimson & green & linen (envelopment of absence) & yellow & medium

capabilities (not limiting the resistor solely to furniture although most inanimate elements are furniture or decoration)) elements from the eventscape) & organismresist (ghost white (presence of absence) & moccasin & silver & purple & <<Gainsboro>> & dark magenta & dodger blue & chocolate & salmon & azure are separating living organisms from the eventscape) & mechanicalresist (blushing

eventscape) & representationresist (orange & green paleness & white (true absence) & aqua & lime & medium turquoise & violet red paleness & orange red & roseate mistiness & vague blue are separating representational surrogations from the eventscape) & terrainresist (vague sea green & vague cyan & teal & medium purple & navy blue & true sky blue are separating environmental terrains (not necessarily natural) from the eventscape) & superstructureresist (vernal green & magenta & cadet blue & turquoise paleness are separating all intrinsic structural organizations from the eventscape) & humorresist (vague true sky blue & mesh vibrant liver & dark cyan & Indian red & <<Alice>> blue & medium blue are separating all humor & irony & cleverness from circumstances or presentations within the eventscape) & metaphorresist (brunneous hyperbolic parabaloid & almond (blanchingly) & lavender & plum & dark orange & firebrick & orchid & <<Sienna>> & yellow green & dark slate blue & sandy brunneousness are separating all nonmaterial interstitial tissues from the eventscape) & movementresist (powdery blue & old laciness & dark orchid & vague yellow & slate blue & olive drab & forest green & sea green & ivory (administrative absence) & cornflower blue & vague pink & cornsilk are separating all tendencies for the expectation of movement (retreating from the advancements of formal literacy (the expectation or intuiting of movement from a static composition) initiating in contrapposto)) & parallaxresist (pink & red & chartreuse & dark olive green & gray dimness & honeydew (abiogenetic birthing of absence) & vibrant liver & dark blue are separating the construction of depth through the specific mechanism of parallax layering from the eventscape) & depthresist (snowiness (voxelization of absence) & tomato & hot pink & vague green & beige & floral white (absence) & dark gray & brunneousness are separating atmospheric characteristics necessary for promoting the illusion of depth in the eventscape) & enclosureresist (mesh purple & blue & bisque & vague gray & violet & gold & steely blue & puffy peach & fluffy papaya & vague steely blue & creamy mintgreen & lawn green & vague goldenrod are separating material continuities from the eventspace for foregrounding the inherent porosity of the physical environment) & emotionresist (wheat & dark goldenrod & medium sea green & dark green & goldenrod & aquamarine & slate gray & burlywood & vague salmon & <<Rebekah>> purple & dark slate gray are separating bathetic structuring of physical relationships between elements from the eventscape) & languageresist (cyan & olive & khaki & lime green & midnight blue & blue violet are separating any structuring that is proposing linguistic interdependencies or modeling syntactical predications on the relationships between elements in the eventscape) & patinaresist (fuchsia & mesh green & dark turquoise is separating the visual manifestations of weathering (both superficial as with oxidation & structural as with collapsing) & wearing from human interaction (particularly with the patinaresist there is a tendency for assuming the functionality of resistors is the paralysis of decayal or changing of appearance or structural properties however this is a perception from without the singular event boundingbox that is expecting linkages & causality from one event to the next rather than focusing on the stability of inanimateness within the boundingbox) from the eventscape) & idealresist (medium aquamarine & vague coral & tannery brunneousness are separating the structural fundamentals of (objective) proportioning & (subjective) elegance or gracefulness from the eventscape) & decayresist (greenyellow & dark sea green & brunneous rosacea &

such as the etching of lithic outcroppings by the saxicolous lichen <<Lecidea tessellata>> or the <<Tiling lichen>>) from the eventscape) & narrativeresist (medium slate blue & Navajo white & deep pink & dark salmon & dark violet & dark khaki & medium orchid & indigo & dark red & deep sky blue & thistle & gray & lemon chiffon & smoky white (false absence) are separating the suggestion of causal structuring encodable in predicative adjacency from the eventscape))) horizontally (outside) & vertically (inside) and whose next layerings are indium tin oxide electricalfields with directional etching (horizontally (outside) & vertically (inside))) nesting a central nematic (alkylpyrimidine with cyanobiphenyl) imagespace, a hypothesis that the boundingbox is the event rather than containing the event on the basis of its containing the imagespace, however a sixth stratum on the outside of the entire assemblage is an orientable reflective stratum projecting information inward leading to the competing hypothesis that the geometry of the event is in fact native to its constituents within the boundingbox whose sole existence is interevent separation or event discreteness (EDisc), the term boundingbox is misleading, it isn't (or needn'tly isn't) a cubic or oblong rectangular prism but any volumetric watertight geometry with packing capability, the boundingbox is the threshold or background of an event with necessarily nothing beyond it including another event (although the geometric constraint of a packable volume is suggesting otherwise), other events are within the containment of the the boundingbox not as nestings but as folding unders togglingly blossoming adirectionally (such that what is presumably precedent or antecedent) destroying the event fully mature exploding from the womb of its inaccessible manifolds, the notion of a fully mature human within the uterus of another fully mature human is necessitating an interceding conversion or tweening or motionsmoothing, framerate upconversion methods including blackframe insertion & framerepetition & temporal frameaveraging without motion conversion are producing motion jerkiness (spasmolytic), convulsive, development of <<3dimensionally recursive searching>> is expanding the simple 2dimensional (utilizing flattenings of the nematic imagespace from any single faceting of the boundingbox (all facetings of even the most complex boundingbox geometry (including those with amorphis nonpolyhedral geometries) are containing all information from within the volume including the information of all other events within the volume) of any event in the motionpicture) upconversions into spatial blocking predictions (linear quadratic motion estimation & trilateral filtering motionsmoothing), for events with exceptional motion complexity or parallax superposition numerically adjacent eventscapes are not usually identical due to the exacerbation of noise, each tweenframe is containing all other events, mutations of eventscape characteristics within tweenframes are propagating novel trajectories whose development on the basis of Darwinian evolutionary principles are thriving or failing as configurations of hermetic reality, more robust (zero Gaussian noise) blockmatching is reducing the error trajectory yet is also reducing the vitality of the evolutionary eventpool, a beneficial development is utilizing selectionsets of eventblocks where cubic numbers of canditates are evaluatable against antecedent & precedent events for premiation with a large percentage of the selectionset being sterile, for the smallest multicelluar cubic of 8 there is 1 premiating candidate & 6 sterile candidates & 1 viable nonpremiating candidate which is establishing a branching trajectory eventscape, larger cubics (below rootings of 1000) 909853209 for example is producing 113731651 viable eventscapes that although these are not premiating are unavoidably containing perceptors who are embracing the eventscape as valid, this is concerning to the ADA who is imposing destruction searchings through as many eventscapes as possible for situations in which administrative protocols are mutating beyond a threshold necessary for maintenance of the faith, destruction of such faithless eventscapes is simply through debriding any one of the resistor hues creating an overwhelming sense of internal momentum that is wracking the event and its constituent precedents & antecedents apart,
