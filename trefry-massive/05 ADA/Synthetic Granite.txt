the fabrication of artificial (or synthesis of administrative) granite (or synthetic granitoids (or <<Syngra>>)) is utilizing small fragmentations & pulverizations & remnantal grains of urgranite (the thermonuclear excavation of the Angara-Vitim batholith) from the radioactive (strontium 90 & cesium 137) spoiling pilings of granite quarrying tailings & the crushing of idolatrous theistic or anthropic monuments (per the corporeal abstraction of the Daemon all public art is stereometric) & large solid volumes of imperfect granite (no larger than a walnut), the application of <<Syngra>> methods is allowing for the pouring & molding of any morphological complexity in the fabrication of leonine statuary & lavatories & dracontine statuary & strigiform statuary & outdoor furniture & bas reliefs & equine statuary & Anubis & ranine statuary & columns & chelonian statuary & yukimi doro & Pietas & naturalistic boulders & cherubic statuary & pantherine statuary & elements of staircases (balusters & newelposts & risers & stairtreads & handrails & bracketings (scrolling or skirting) & overeasings & endreturns & tandemcaps & gooseneckings & turnouts) & aquiline statuary & millstones & Osiris & volutes & bathtubs & funerary monuments (headstones & cenotaphs & pyramids & pillar tombs & sarcophagi & recumbent effigies (because actual depictions of humans are unacceptable these effigies are grotesquely endearing approximations utilizing combinations of stereotomic polyhedra) & mausoleums) & fountains & ornamental garden seating & any other geometric approximation of an extant objecttype, heating the pulverization of granite (and porphyritic phenocrysts of quartz & feldspar & plagioclase) to 1540C (40C above its liquidus temperature (heating to 59C or more above the liquidus temperature and shocking the crucible of molten material in a cold waterbath is producing a blueblack porphyry (resembling <<janusite>> (often among the contraband of spuriously innocuous flashingstones in White Sea prisoncamps) that is not tractable to complex molding apparatuses)) is annealingly crystallizing at the solidus temperature in similarly phaneritic texturing, within the temperature neighborhood of crystallization (between 1200C & 1325C) initiation of the crystallization is occuring in a variety of ways including ionic production or covalent production or seedgrain crystallinity or mafic crystallinity or ultramafic crystallinity or cumulation or boules or Bridgman-Stockbarger crystallization or epitaxy or Kyropoulos crystallization or Verneuil crystallization or Czochralski crystallization, as a proof of concept the an assistant to the administrative synthesizer (Intesa) is stepping across a noncombustible hearth is placing 20g of granitic pulverization in an unglazingly raw opentop porcelain crucible is baking in a refractory blastburner furnace is billowing vapor through the opentop bafflecylinder (protecting the crucible from the proximate conflagration of the blowtorch) into fata morgana distortions of concrete efflorescence in the austere laboratory, an aircompressor is discharging through a tube into a receiver with the equipment of a pressuregauge, utilizing an asbestos ladle Intesa is adding an additional increment of 20g of pulverization (either porphyritic or phaneritic materials are allowable in the second increment) upon liquefication of the initial 20g of granitic pulverization as maintenance of 1540C temperature is continuing for the addition of a third (porphyritic or phaneritic) increment of 20g, the blastburner furnace is increasing to 1600C with the full quantity of 60g of granitic pulverization is liquid for a tempering purification is offgassing iron and other impurities out of the crucible as slag is skimmingly sheeting from the liquid, the purification of the granitic liquid at 1600C is pourably (the crucible is liftingly transitioning with asbestos tongs from the blastburner to a radiant kiln or lehr at 1325C) filling a hot mould (complex morphologies are accommodatable with springform moulds (analagous to rococo ceremonial headcheese moulds)), the entire mould is returning to the furnace where a temperature of 1325C is slowly reducing to 1200C is initiating the crystallization & annealing procedure whereupon the mould is returning to the radiant kiln for more rapid cooling is generating a vibratory tone against the steel mould not unlike singing sanddunes singing a deep & cryptically mournful dirge abstraction, at 300C the moulds are suitable for moving outdoors (regardless of ambient temperatures) for arrangement into phalanges (utilizing the long rankings of the maniple for filling the abandonment of roadways for cooling moulds), an optimal cooling regimen is allowing for any tooling procedures applicable to natural granite including sandblasting & acidwashing & axing & flaming (the performance of such tooling is in an environment with equipment for dustcollection (both airborne particulates (through a vacuumarray) & settling particulation (through a sieving floorgrate)) for recouping the spoilage of the tooling procedure for additional liquification & moulding),
