the proliferation navmesh & the auto & the pantograph & the mastless pantograph are transforming the conventions of urban morphology & pyschogeographic expectations of city organization with the supression of the intuitive wayfinding inherent in the democratizing (a disingenuous concept predicated on the necessity of endlessness (any geographic termination of the grid institutes a hierarchy as does the zoning of the grid development where public services create implied centers)) organization of the citygrid, although still gridlike the continuity of vectors is virtual and upon its obstruction by a building may not be reuptaking for many kilometers (the most significant disruption is the <<Tsentergrad ↕ Daemonaz Island Virtual Axis>> & the longest continuity is the <<Greenville ↔ Yinxiong Island Axis>>), the city is not a reflection of human society, all building construction in the ADAemone is on the basis of nonrepresentational schematics latent within the platter (whether the method for their execution is autoconstruction (batching concrete automixing and automining from regolith is assembling precast wallpanels, autoconcrete patching is a boomoperating trowel with a sensor for spalling or microvariations in atmospheric density) or conventional construction by laborers (although execution of conventional construction is solely on the basis of fidelitous application of autoconstruction precedent reconstruction)), architectural drawings are nonexistent, the platter is intergranitically communicating with autoconstruction equipment (through the throbbings of their quartzes (whose piezoelectricity is transferable via any other piezoelectric material whose containment in a <<Whiteread compensator>> is affecting a grain of material in the destination artifact by remanentic entanglement is enabling persistent longrange communication between the two)) & conventional construction is on the basis of oversight by a masterbuilder (guidance by a masterbuilder is continuous and several masterbuilders are typically on assignment for a particular construction undertaking) whose knowledge of precedents of autoconstruction edifices is comprehensive and is only communicating via onsite verbal promptings & hardcopy verbal specifications, the idealization of iconography & proportion & circulatory rhetoric & materiality & functionality & programmatic adjacencies & urban morphology (with all attendant intentionalities of contextual consistency & urban movement systems) & daylighting & constructional logic is embodying a simple truth (a deduction of the platter) that the most effective composition for any construction is a rectangular prism, Alpinist is embracing and enacting an aspiration of automating construction across the entirety of the ADAemone as an expression of the endless material resources of the continent is resulting in buildings ((whose locations are so geographically remote or whose sequestration within the fabric of autoconstruction is so deep that expeditions (which are necessarily on foot) are incapable of reaching them) no human is ever seeing or occupying or having awareness of during its construction or in its lifespan (with the exception of masterbuilder acolytes traveling by autogyro <<en tournée>> (the indoctrination of a masterbuilder is highly ritualistic and arduously involving training of the capacity for spatial intelligence & memorization & visualization techniques & oration & technical communication and subsequent immersion into the autoconstruction inventory of a particualar voronoi, no documentation is permissible <<en tournée>> such that the oeuvre of a singular masterbuilder is a highly repetitive improvisation on a very small sampling of architecture or aspect of architectural vocabulary none of which is especially fidelitous to its precedents although any kind of pedestrian comparison is impossible (most citizens are of the belief that masterbuilders are responsible for the creation of their own bespoke architectural visions)) beyond the notion that the buildings are inhospitable & alienating (as is the outcome of reproductions of reproductions (reproductions without originals))) whose cult secrecy is equivalent to mysterious isolation or nonexistence of the physical artifacts of the autoconstruction) with urban morphologies (urban without the conventional meaning of rural/urban binary because the unrestriction of construction on the basis of landuse & necessity in lieu of landuse & necessity is manifesting in endless cityscape (city as the only terminology that is describing the physical disposition but without any of its cultural or social implications)) on the basis of a 15puzzle in the midst of solving with rectangular elements sliding beside one another along vectors whose interruption by larger components are instituting new vectors, all is static to the explorer in its midst yet in a more geographic analyis is apparently fluctuating, down a long alley whose proportions are closing out the sky, intersecting other alleys where phantom glowings are teasing admission of skylight, the vision is deceptive in undifferentiable twilight manifesting not hallucinatory minutiae but luminance, the typology of the AAA is <<endless crepidoma>>, fleeing into the autoconstruct (or <<Bachman's Interzone>> or <<Bach>> or the <<Zone>> or the <<Twilightscape>> or the <<Underexposure>> or the <<Underzone>>), banishment into the autoconstruct, Ben Richards is flying an autogyro into the pinnacle of the <<Mndoyants>>, the <<Underzone>> is characterizable as rural although it is a construction at the behest of humans, wildlife running through the <<Underzone>> & occupying the partial envelopment of buildings with decaying facades, giant nesting areas on roofs, racoondog & flyingsquirrel & snowleopard & Kamchatka brownbear & moonbear & pale thrush & Turukhan wolf & Daemonic adder & Ussuri mamushi & elk & Siberian lynx & Amur tiger & Phlegra cinereofasciata & musk deer & birch sawfly, autogyro skycranes carrying crates of prisoners for airdrop into the <<Underzone>> whose parachutes are drifting hundreds of kilometers across the cityscape where the urban fabric is so continuous & dense that no happenstance LZ is plausible the crates are landing on roofs or buffetting off of cornices & tumblingly deteriorating down the chasms between windowless facades, very few exilees to the <<Underzone>> are surviving airdrop, construction without landuse hierarchy or human sensibility (the basis of theories on aesthetics & beauty (or minimally on conceptual congruence (adherence to any aspiration for an undertaking regardless of whether it is aesthetically pleasing (making the experiential product of an undertaking unpleasant & evocative of despair (or causing despair)))) or practical tenets of human usage & accessibility) the footprint & height of each construction is not rhythmic or contextual yet as in all vast systems a noisy consistency is observable from a distant enough vantage, the most distinctive manifestations of the endless cityscape (relatively consistent scaling (approximately the volume of a massive 12000m3 (from the prototypical massive whose measurements are 80m x 12m x 12.5m) although with infinite proportional variations within a spectrum bracketing with the squattest being 70m x 70m 2.5m and the slenderest being 6m x 6m x 333m (although the autoconstruction techniques are lacking the sophistication necessary for precisely rectalinear construction all of the buildings are species of parallelepiped (including cuboids (including (infrequent) actual cubic massings & squarish cuboids & rectangular cuboids) & parallelogrammic prisms & trigonal trapezohedra (often as golden rhombohedra) & common parallelepipeds))) although none being exceptionally acute instead are typically imperceptibly nonright, all constructions are in isolation from one another (no partywalls) by a minimum width allowing passage of an 1.65 autos (such that vehicles are incapable of passing one another although a pedestrian (although no there is no distinction in the street crosssection (bitumen) between roadway and pedestrian sidewalk) is capable of passing an auto) but never by more than 6m, this consistent density is unifying the variation of proportion such that local perception is of heterogeneity and regional perception is of homogeneity) are the examples of Alpinist Administrative Architecture ((or <<AAA>>) a kind of skyscraper distinctive for its terracing & inverse massing proportions (broader tierlevels are shorter & smaller footprint tierlevels are taller which with adherence to a terracing typology is assigning the bottom tierlevel as a vast lowslung carpeting & the top tierlevel as an incredibly tall and slender occupiable pinnacle)), the typology of the AAA is <<endless crepidoma>> (the centerpoints of the tierlayers or steppings are not in vertical alignment, the massing is noncentrosymmetric such that in extreme examples the pinnacle is distant from the centerpoint of the stylobate (the <<Rostkovskiy>> pinnacle is 949m from the centerpoint of its stylobate), nor is organization of tierlayer centerpoints on the basis of any unifying logic such that vertices of prisms in some examples are in alignment), the local logic of the AAA highrise is obfuscating the relentless aperiodic illogic of the massing fabric of autoconstruction, 7 AAAs (or <<The Seven Sisters>>) are extant throughout the ADA (in the vicinities of Murbayskiy Nasleg (the <<Rudnev>>) & (the wilderness west of) Aikhal (the <<Mordvinov>>) & the Putorana Municipal Natural Reservation (the <<Gelfreykh>>) & Lake Ypkyl'to (the <<Polyakov>>) & Strezhevoy (the <<Rostkovskiy>>) & Novoperunovo (the <<Mndoyants>>) & Moren (the <<Dushkin>>) (the centerpoint of which (in an octagon whose completion is the questionable sister on the floor of Lake Baikal) is in the vicinity of the rural locality of Baikit (drawing down into the earth in a circular depression with a diameter far less than the distance between an observer and the horizon such that the lip of the depression is omnipresent and the basin floor containing the entirety of Baikit is relatively flat))), the <<Chechulin>> is an 8th AAA is under construction in Lake Baikal (in the northeast zone of its central basin (depth approximately 1600m (in all events containing the construction of the <<Chechulin>> only the cofferdam reaching the lakefloor is visibly underway (all 7 (or 8) Sisters are approximately 1.5km in height with a watertable or stylobate that is equivalent in width to its height such that its virtual volume is a cubic mass is placing the potential pinnacle of the <<Chechulin>> 100m below the lip of the cofferdam (a rigid inflatable watercraft is approaching the <<Chechulin>> construction area navigating around icefloes toward the pumping platform is torrenting lakewater (the volume of the cofferdam is necessitating the pumping of 3.6km3 of lakewater which is adding 0.1135mm to the entire 31722km2 surfacearea of Lake Baikal) from within the cofferdam (which could be the original evacuation or a persistent bilging of leaking at the floor of the cofferdam (with or without the completion of the <<Chechulin>> within)) within 1km of the cofferdam is being drawn below the watersurface by a large metal hydraulic pincer)))) where construction apparatuses are visible on the horizon from the shoreline of Ust-Barguzin (construction staging from the abandonment of <<Lower Cape Headboard>> encampment (or <<The Sacramental Nose of the Daemon>>) at Svyatoi Nos)),
