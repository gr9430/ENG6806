division of the safemargin (aspect ratio is the purview of the editor) into 4 quadrilateral videoframes (aspect ratios are the purview of the editor), there is no preference that these quadrilaterals are remaining consistent ((Robert Wise is using a similar technique in montage scenes in <<The Andromeda Strain>>) obviously unless the 4 quadrilaterals are identical aspect ratios that are equally dividing the X & Y axes of the safemargin there is necessarily exposure of negativespace (the RGB hue of the negativespace (there is no preference that this negativespace hue is remaining consistent (although if it is varying it is doing so through abrupt cutting rather than graduating from one hue to another)) is the purview of the editor) behind the videoframes) individually or in relation to one another, within each of these videoframe quadrilaterals is playing different vantagepoints (of 4 distinct performances) of a stageperformance by a shirtless man reciting a soliloquy (doth (<) any here know me, this embodiment is not Lear, does Lear walk thus--calculatingly and with obvious rehearsal--into the intimate oratorium of this rococo rhetoric, where are his eyes (<), either his selfnotion is weakening, his discernings are lethargizing--waking, ha! never sleeping never not in an awake manifestation, who is it that can tell me who I am--so many embodiments singing on audio of the embodiments in divisi, imbroglio, trending toward tutti and crescendo (<) is the flowsound of freeon through capillary tubing, a hissing liquidity onomatopoetic of human speech in a choral is declaring--You, I, He, are Lear's shadow, Lear's umbra, the occultation of his and my intangibility (<), not the gaseous powderiness ascribable to the projective shadow with its volumetric graphite toothsomeness, but a dimensionless liquid delineating the morphology of every transparent vessel--jars & phials & beakers--Berzelius, bloom test--, flasks--conical, roundbottom, Engler, volumetric, Erlenmeyer, iodine, piriform--, cylinders, bell jars, pipettes, Vigreux columns, Woulff bottles--with low viscosity fluid in the gestalt hue of a human body including all organs, viscera, bones, hair, skin, cancers, tissue, bilious stomach contents at the time of death (<) is spurtingly flooding into the glass vessel which is nominally an <<Embodiment>> with very specific geometry and performance specifications albeit inanimate save the tidally sloshing movement of the human fluid, howl, howl, howl, howl into the flaring glass nipple and surgical rubber hose connector with integral vacuum receiver adapter, is the fluid drawn from the ether, is that from where we exist and where we cease to be, eaters of disintegral meats exhaling my vaporwave as it cools is a cloud of chum (<) desirous of physiognomic scripting the entire cast of characters through capillary tubes of tormenting refrigerant coursing through the preparatory circuit in which a second solenoid valve and a second capillary tube having a different throttle value are in parallel to the solenoid valve and the capillary tube leading to each <<Embodiment>>, this refrigerant darkness phasechanging us all to fools and madmen and fathers carrying the corpses (<) of his daughters who are fools and both <<Embodiments>> are father and daughter rushing through the capillary tubing into a new vessel whose geometry is ideal for whipping, whipping out the truth, whipping out lies, whipping out silence (<)) reflecting on his interminable performance of the role of King Lear, the 4 distinct performances of the same soliloquy are differing in their cadence and although their original durations are differing the editor is throttling the playback (the throttling of the playback is not consistent across the duration of the performance but is on the basis of aligning keywords in the soundtrack of each performance such that both soundtrack & videotrack are slowing or accelerating as necessary that all 4 performances are concurrently uttering each of the keywords (annotation of these keywords is with the symbol of a crescendo (<) following the word in the text)) of each such that their durations are identical, the soundlevels of the soundtracks of the 4 individual videoframes are at the purview of the editor for the preservation of some semblance of clarity in the overall apprehension of the text, sounddesign is including the ebbing & flowing of a poorly performing mechanical system in the theater though not to the volume at which it is competing with the performance,
