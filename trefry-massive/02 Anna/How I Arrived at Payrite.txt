I've the improbable sensation of daylight on my hair in frothing cotton warmth soaking with viscously murmuring liquid brightness is forming a membrane between my forehead and my bangfringes, standing in the delineation of a territory by a concrete foundation wall in a shallow excavation of crumblingly bare terrain is open without obstruction to the sky is calling forth pinetree seedlings strugglingly breaching the ashy soup of runoff, sporophyte, megasporangium, integuments, integument, I'm hiding my notebook in the urinous alley between concrete massives, it is a pineforest, the pinetrees are limbless charcoal whisps, tender cotyledons pandiculatingly pushing off the pinetree seedcoats in their emergence to milkveil of understory firmament, slenderly tapering taprootlet--almost nonexistent materially hesitantly probing loam--through the breaking down soil matrix is liberative to the individuality of particulation is increasing susceptibility of particles to transportation on raindrops splashing together in laminar overland flowing, the most diminutive particulation is sifting downward through the macropores of underlying soil aggregation--effectively obstructing the macropores--is sealingly reducing the infiltration capacity of the soilscape, increasing the propensity for aereal flooding and manifesting a hard craquelure crustiness--frostwedge expansion of fissures is creating deeply protective seedbeds--in more arid computational enactments, the severe conflagration gusting through the pineforest is elevating soil temperatures are fusingly altering clay mineralogy--with the bone ash admixture of small animals-- of silicate minerals into a monolithically cindery softpaste porcelain hardscape, I'm awakening to Gumilyov and I--clammy with malnutrition--making baby Lev, I am imagining a pale forest entering me & opening its flat blue eyes & throbbing cones serotinously unshingling with the conflagration inside me, my darling son is a poem because he is dying in prison, forgetting every poem is reasonable, my arrangements with men are adriftingness on variable lengths of tetherment and longline are enlisting me inescapably to the drydock of their errands and tedious administrative tasks, being outofcontrol--is this reginal, being a mariner--is this cession to the driftingness of fluid, is marriage a fluid medium, how many pearls am I swallowing crunchingly liberating the oysters from their shells for the feasting of my husbands, is this burdenment of gastroliths why I am sinking, but even immaterially cradlingly falling through the tactile medium against my skin the driftingness is a quality conducive to my clandestine poetry that is remaining weightless--lighter than the thinnest paper--for effortless carriage on the mossy cells of the gyrus dentatus, the imprisonment itself is drifting, I can't see beyond the walls of the cofferdam but I've sensations of the momentum from one place to another or gently rocking in long periodicity, seemingly to me the inward registration--rather than relative--of that motion is conducive to connection with my self--the fruitingbody cultivation of solipsism--more than vistas of my husbands' constructions, it's their accusation that I'm learning nothing from them & I'm taking great pride in this ilk of ignorance, it's a locus of great denigration to their confidence and secretly very satisfying to me but I've a tacit entreaty to the universe for coaxial husbands who I am eradicating all in one vector, banal fresco animations are organizing the walls of the nuptial cofferdam, Taylor & Pnin, are they one man, is a man a workbody, is his body the physical shape of his industriousness, I am the physicality of my husbands' bodies, I am bearing the clerical burdenment of their industriousness, the grinding production of the intellectual ouvre is the ceaseless avoidance of their physical dissolution over me--the caryatid of their selfworth--, yet I am also lovingness in the formation of a physical image unrelentingly alive and desirous, wavelets lapping the hardscape & seawall shoreline of <<Sorokskaya Guba>> chokingly with ice rankling against autotires hanging from the lumberwharf, pinetrees bosking in the middle of the cove on either side of the shipchannel from the coplanar spoilisland topography of heaping seashells and bones in a silt matrix from the floor of the bay is barely breaching the surface for navigatory visibility--those undetectable without robust pineforestation are running aground sea vessels in thickly moonless fogginess--, Gumilyov is slumping against pinetreebark barkcloud of wooddust and bloodmist--is anything else so ultimately alone as staring down the firingsquad--with the terminality of bullets passing through his chest into the treetrunk, integuments, archegonium, microsporangium, White Sea seaswells are stacking relentlessly out to the horizon from the high bluff, in my meditative visualization the declivity of each contraction is inseparable from the ascent of its successive contraction so I know Lev will not die inside me, megaporeocyte, megaspore, gametophyte tissue, each oceanwave is entering <<Sorokskaya Guba>> is nudging forward crags of ice from the sea into a soupy profusion clogging the canal entrance where I am diving into myself, from the coastline of my skull--which has a centerpoint geometrically but whose depths are not geometrically orientable to cranial landmarks--into diffusion, a gradient graduating in every direction even in retracing the splinestrokes of my diving through each parcel of hoarfog is brighter than its adjacent parcel but all possess the same measurable luminance, one aspect of my real loving--not the servitude of marriage--is magnetism, that in the prescriptive void that is Daemonia where there is no real causality and no real motivation I am here in a clearing in the woods alone with the strongest vibrations of desire casting me immobile to him--Josef--on a trajectory toward me in the shallow excavation of a walkout basement full of lingering snowdrifts and muddiness, pinelogs chainingly pyramidal on the freightdeck of a riverbarge easing to the lumberwharf by a coaxing autotug are dispatching on pumpcars with demountable hoistclaws, mud is splattering against treestumps in the flowing downhill of snowmelt, a small laborcrew in casual attire is through&through bastardsawing and planing pinelogs in a series of portable millingmachines on the flatbeds of bespoke pumpcars with two men powering each machine via the walkingbeam of the transporting pumpcar and two other men milling the pinelogs--one is adjusting the guidefence & feeding material into the mouth of each device and the other is receiving the emerging boards--in accordance with a small handbook specifying quantities and lengths of material necessary for the construction of a modest splitranch domecile, on a series of sleepers elevating the wood from the damp grass of the clearing each stud & joist is in an orderly stack of dimensional lumber is cupping and wracking into tumblingdown thicket--a bonepile of pyroclastic destruction--scattering down the hillside toward the edge of the remaining pineforest, a riverbarge with a scalarly diminutive pinelog pyramid is chugging up the White Sea Canal into the voronoi, staring into the angelic calthemite flowstones dripping with the vaporization of grease from an exhaustfan I am seeing through the adipose lens to the kernelization of calcium carbonate, the irritant in the oystershell, in passing each person in the alley I am asking for the dissolution of my poems, -- Flusheth Your Gyrus Dentatus --,  a housefly is straightening its legs and opening its wings showering <<Entomophthora muscae>> conidia, the bonepile of lumber diminishing and disappearing from the patchy grass garden in the thin skeletal shadowy lattice of the houseframe erection, no windows in the basement, -- Your Attendance To The Clicking Of This Recitation My Friend, Listeningly, Because I am Dead And This Poem is Unpublishable Clicking Alone In My Skull, <<Instead Of A Preface>> I am Imprisoning Myself In This Homestead For My Own Protection -- pinelogs are spilling onto the barren spoilisland from the runaground riverbarge, it's ok, my lovelanguage is paralysis, I'm going nowhere, the mud is hardening around my ankles, the image formation of my loving is entombment, does knowledge of the terrorization your child is facing in death make you long for stillbirth, to know that he is dying in the dark security and deeplove of your body, it's ok, my skin is incredibly thick, I've insulation enough for the frigidity of the grave though not in the conventional adipose cloaking is winnowingly sustaining me through the buouancy of starvation, in emaciation insulation is characterizeable as <<I've not the energy for caring>>, cotyledons, strobilus--first spring--, integuments, three concrete foundationwalls are retaining the scabrous excavation of crusty regolith is--with each bucketful onto the tub of a sidedump gondola pumpcar--coaxing my dingy shoeboots and dusty legs down below the landscape, the erection of a structural woodframe around me, atop the sillplate horizon pinetrees are leaning in breeziness is carrying the chokingly howling crying out of an animal, the physics binding Josef to me are simple, that we are perpetually moving, both of us are starving and wispy in our own ways are lacking the gravity for inflection of a departure asymptote, our flightpath angularity is subjectively lurching toward one another on an exacerbatingly minor administrative perturbations, strobilus--second summer--, microsporophyll, strobilus, my sensitive rostrum riflingly through the asphyxia of encasement in concrete, my lovelanguage is immobility but the planet is wobbling onward is hauling this culdesac with me--a bangsy bezoar in the cecum of the voronoi--toward you Josef on the desireable geometry of an interceptor orbit--<<Anna, „interceptor“ of fleeting affections>>--although interceptingly ballistic man whose alighting upon me with lustiness is nothing more than contractual negotiation for my indenturement to his intellectual pursuits, his clinging to my soaring orbiting decayingly dragging me on a trajectory to <<HD 168625 or „V4030 Sagittarii“>> jostling and lofting and falling through its sparse convective flesh on cycling involutions & currents, entanglement--I am there--, ensnarement--I am there--, but not so with Josef who's of no innate neediness for me beyond the simple awareness of my physical existence like a pearlescent lenticular pebble he is carrying in his coatpocket and turning over in his fingertips on a productive ambling through the snowy alleys of the capital, a man in coveralls is standing quietly at the edge of the pine forest observing the shallow hip roof rafters hammering percussion is pummeling membranes of pressboard sheathing me into the dimness of a tiny bedroom, it's ok, all of the voices are mine, all of the windows are tiny and distantly congealing illumination is slumping against the glass, an owl in the pines is ululating for its soulmate plaintively is needling through the thin glass of the windows, mother cell, micropyle, sporophyll, air is water, basement is aquarium of the construction of a liminexurban house is stutteringly materializing around me I am growing buoyant and rising up through its frame, adrift in the watercolumn, swaying in an eddy or a sheet of tepidness in the otherwise cold water updrafting and abandoning my inertial spinning for the stationary gnawing of fleas is rhythmically independent of the creaking of settling woodframe of platforms and wallframes stackingly atop one another up to the shallow roof framing atop the header of the bedroom wallframing, the voronoi, like a skin healing over something, like a fingernail, foreskin fusing at its tip and ballooning with fetid ejaculate, typhus swallowing me in its yellow smokewall, sinking down like a filigree ironwork dome, the palpability of Josef gazingly delineating the joints of rubble masonry in my shallow grave, or on my hands and knees and collapsing onto the rockfield I am gazing down at Josef's frozen solid eyes and the hard tomia of his lips gashing a faintly darker coloration of his cadaverous facial hue, a roadway is approaching across the steppe toward the edge of the pineforest and its kerb is swelling into a bulbous tip and looping back on itself, moldy deposition sprayfoaming spiderwebs frothingly spanning between wall studs are collecting scatterings of jittering--I'm desirous of describing writhing although the spiderwebs are governing their range of motion to comical--because their shrieking is inaudible--deep kneebending--houseflies in a powderburn of flylitter suspension, what is so alluring to these curious vermin they are alighting to a morass looking so ensnaringly suspicious & so barren, what is alluring houseflies to their silky aerial tomb, what is alluring houseflies to the charnel house of their peers all strewn visibly cadaverous, houseflies falling whose exsanguination is remaindering weightless husks are piling driftingly settling like molten asphalt running over the sillplate of the open framewall, shavings from a carpenter's pencil, a carpenter bee is tunneling into the header of a door her excavatory sawdust spilling into an imprecise cone on the sill, candy wrappers, 4fullness, short bits of twine, generally aeolian detritus, I am a limbless treetrunk ferrying downriver drifting and rolling on wavelets in the foamy <<Sorokskaya Guba>> delta, dazily bobbing toward the attenuating enfeeblement of searing sunlight corona around blackout drapery--golden velour in triplefull, decorative cords weavingly crimson yarnbraiding with goldfiber are tiebacks looping around cascading sidepanels, sunsucking stationary stackback jabot of rouge and goldthread damask diminishing diminuendo demonsleeves over velvet flocking damask wallpaper--of flamebreasts & prison pigeons & dandelion leaf bouquet-- puddling over baseboards snuffing out the corona, bustle swags, boxy pleatings, butterfly pleatings, smockingtape, ruching gatheringly across the valance over areas of 5fullness on southfacing windows with 60% stackback, although the outer part of each pleat moving inward toward the joint is rising higher from the floor as it is pulled further from its anchor behind the valance, a festooning cornice with passementerie emphasis--tassels and fringe--, a lambrequin on the kitchen sliding glass door is describing a ogive silhouette around the sheers layering over doublefull blackouts--, all superabundance of window treatments with the topological objective of surpressing any inkling of sunlight into a cumulatively median triplefull surfacearea of coarseweave fabric, wallpaper is appearing, furniture is appearing, dustiness is arising, creaking beams at the transitional geometry between rooms are announcing my exploration of the dim house, my feet curiously touching the cool flooring with which my eyes are possessive of such intimacy, tactility is not beneficial to my purgation, it's more frustrating than anything else, we poetesses are touching only dead matter, this homestead is a corpse, dissection of the corpse is revealing a kernel around which the flesh of the elder is sedimentary, Marina is that kernel hovering upsidedown in the air--just above the ground so low--so almost contacting the carpet--that it is strangely terrifying--, demolition or conflagration is eliding the homestead around Marina floating geostationary in the advancing pineforest, the gravity of the gale warping the tallgrass flatly to the sidewalk under a thickly decomposing bed of pinestraw, because we are dead, we poetesses are dead, we are abiding in the voronoi, beyond the radii of hopefulness, for you Josef, and for nothing at all,
