leaving Josef behind on a cold afternoon in the far east), goodness he is so magnetic even as he is terrible even in his most manipulative even in his most aloof he is presenting the most compellingly threatening embarrassment for not following his protocols, even as familiar an abusee as I am his particular methodology of patriarchal criticism is never familiar, men are indulging literature with such reverence outside themselves although it could not be a more intimate performance, in the dark alone at a desk, literature is not in a theater or walking through the streets, Josef with <<Divina

murmurings several wallthicknesses away is unmistakably his, that is easily his silhouette (that stack of garbage beside a security floodlight), every cognition every corona of every everyday item is such a fluid entrance into reveries of him that I am sitting down with the firm intentions of thinking deeply on a subject so remote (knitting stitchcharts & yogurt beverage recipes & Parisian cityplanning) although the edgelines of a facet of knowledge are inescapably metamorphosing into the geometry of his pursing lips (although the animation of his lips moving are foreign, although I've

dead of tubercular meningitis>>, my palms on the gauzy bedspread in this roominghouse (the final chamber of my life) reading the cinéroman <<L'Année dernière à Marienbad>> is raising the conundrum of whether all of Robbe-Grillet's texts are transcriptions of (or constructions toward) cinematic visual languages or are indulging in the infrathin of the cinematic veneer, because Robbe-Grillet's cinéroman is utilizing the formal conceits of the conventional screenplay (framing compositions & camera movements & sounddesign & blocking & direction) <<L'Année dernière à Marienbad>> is activating a tacit infrastructure that is ephemerally interlacing the grammar of the rest of his novels that instead of rhetorically guiding the kinoeye consciousness is enumerating the choreography of a referential camera whose existence is lying outside the text, indulging the visual construction of Robbe-Grillet's prose is unavoidable, the setdressing and the geolocation of cipherlike human figures is consistent between the exemplary <<Dans le labyrinthe>> and the exceptional <<L'Année dernière à Marienbad>> however the way the consciousness is utilizing the prose for the parallel visual construction of the attendant images is different (is there a biochemical difference between the cognitive manifestation of visual stimuli and imagery novel to hermetic brain (is there an additional distinction or a more precise distinction of the mind visualizing something which is a recollection of actual stimuli versus something which is nonexistent)) where the verbal construction of an image in <<L'Année dernière à Marienbad>> is pointing outward & sideways to an ultimate cinematic destination with attendantly luminous properties (a focal region in the fusiform gyrus nominally the <<fusiform visage area>> or <<FuViAr>> is delineating the concrete visage of an actor (not necessarily the precise actor (Sacha Pitoëff (star of <<Mother Tenebrarum>> and <<Patrik is Hitherto Living>>

entire bibliography worldsheetingly, publication of the cinéroman <<L'Année dernière à Marienbad>> is falling between the publication of <<Un Régicide>> & <<Les Gommes>> & <<Le Voyeur>> & <<La Jalousie>> & <<Dans le labyrinthe>> and the publication of <<La Maison de rendez-vous>> & <<Projet pour une révolution à New York>> (which is explicitly inviting the camera (as an artifact (a literary setdressing)) and the filmmaking process (not as a analogical structuring mechanism but as plotpoint) into the content of the text (albeit creating a text that is less cinematic than others adjacent to it (specifically <<Topologie d'une cité fantôme>>))) & <<La Belle Captive>> (whose usage of reproductions of paintings by René Magritte is manipulative of textual visualization in an entirely different way) & <<Topologie d'une cité fantôme>> & <<Souvenirs du Triangle d'Or>> (which is customarily the conclusion of his bibliography and during whose publication Robbe-Grillet is dying of

is containing all of Robbe-Grillet's other books within a devouring circumference, from within these volumes the vision outward to the rest of Robbe-Grillet's work as a series of independently functioning bodies is impossible)), -- Women are Visually Clumsy With Their Clothes On -- , Dedo suggestion of my carrying <<Ancient Weird Religious Rites>> by Fuad Ramses in my coatpocket is an insight into the aesthetic affectations he is borrowing from the Egyptology fad, men are appreciative of you obsessively watching their lips moving or waiting patiently for the initiation of movement in their lips, wearing dark hair flatly and fair hair puffy or curly is the height of appropriateness for women, the flatly glib depictions of Mariangela Giordano's various homicides are familiar to me, not that I am a victim of such grisliness but that I am a victim of hostile ambivalence, lacking independent agency by the men I'm legally inviting into my life, I am a useful sculpture, Mariangela Giordano is a setdressing for acting out fantasies of her bespoke homicides (nude internal devourment by a cat, nude Oedipal breast devourment, nude cyclopean ashlar falling on her skull, nude dismemberment in telephonecord bondage on a diningtable, nude fireplace poker sodomizing→impaling, nude dropping from a rooftop, nude sagittal bisection with a voulge (or bardiche), nude

sulla città contaminata>> (or <<Nightmare City>> or <<City of the Walking Dead>>), -- Dead Horses Along Main Street, The Morgue is Aromatic In The Nice Part Of Town -- , in our deaths the texts of Robbe-Grillet and my strange reading habits are commingling, literature to me is reality, and Robbe-Grillet's manipulation of the depiction of reality (in the manner that it is turning reality back into the text itself) is in a way trapping me in the life of words themselves, the texts are such that you cannot be physically outside them looking in, when the book is open it spreads outward or it becomes part of the continuity of the living fabric or the landscape of our dwellings, in this indistinguishable ink ether I am finding a new text (<<Un roman sentimental>>) that unlike the romanesques in their capturing of all the other novels is a standalone depiction of Robbe-Grillet's disgusting soul and in this way swallowing and liquefying & liquidating his entire life of writings, cataloging what Robbe-Grillet is insisting are his preadolescent ur fantasies all involving the sexual degradation & physical assault of girls (who (of his cohort of immaturity at the outset of his fantasies) are a full lifespan his junior upon publication of the work), <<Un roman sentimental>> is a novel in a series of 239 numerical paragraphs each containing (although not in the singular containment of each paragraph (writhing beyond their textual compartments)) precise descriptions of Gigi (or Djinn (14)) as the focal abusee of her father (Doctor Gordon (and his disciple Lewis) a fictionalization of actor Cary Elwes), although the physical punishment & violence is evocative of the mortal injuries of various Christian martyrs (stabbings & bindings to various apparatus & devourment by canines & pointblank shootings & acidbaths & sexual violation with pears of anguish & currycombing & suffocations & vino imbibing→torrential evisceration & bondage drownings & entombments & droppings from great height & theatrical executions & dehydration) the receiver of these activities being a young girl is casting into suspicion the literary legerdemain of readerly voyeurism upon which the majority of Robbe-Grillet's oeuvre is pivoting, in fact the old bastard is just an unrepentant sleazer, and je suis libéré,
