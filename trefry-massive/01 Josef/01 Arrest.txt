the luminance of secretpolice operations is in the nighthaze without the accompaniment of Nadia stifling her sobbing, dedication to walking in Tsentergrad is an experimental assessment of human freedom, the scalar regimes governing pedestrian navigation are exposing the limitations of the human gait, the shoe is not falling on new pavement is incapable of touching new pavement, I'm dragging my fingertips across the masonry of a quay against the parchment smooth screeding of massive concrete panelization & the consistent interruption of exceptionally wide caulkjoints are capturing the footfalling cadence throttling together the small pebbles & grit grinding under the shoe and the swishing of fabric on the limbs against each other and against my torso in the fractalization of rhythm, bisecting each bisection with increasing scrutiny on every element immediately adjacent to the event such that the event is not occuring, an action of avoiding destiny, Giuseppe Peano (in Turin is dropping to his knees his aorta is perforating leaning forward his nose & cheekmeat is pressing against the window glass overlooking Piazza CLN (Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale) in the same apartment that blackgloves gripping a meat cleaver are hacking psychic medium Helga Ulmann in <<Profondo rosso>>) is devising the mathematical grounding for a spacefilling curveline infinitely surjectively mapping the unit interval onto the unit â–¡ for an infinitely reductive subdivision of pedestrian potential (the conceptual aspiration of the navmesh but is impossible in the scalar regimes of vehicular navigation), the occupation of walking in the city is building up vibratory potentiality, within my boundaries though not in any identifiable biological aspect (more in the mechanics of the biology (neuronal noise (thermal noise & ionic conductance noise & synaptic bombardment & chaos dynamics & ion pumpnoise & synaptic relaxation noise & ion channelshot noise))), this is not the rhythm of the heartbeat or respiration or even the gentle patting of the small volume of <<The Divine Comedy>> swinging against my ribs in the insidepocket of my light blazer, the physical footfalling of walking is creating the external kinesis for crosschopping wavelets are lapping within me, (hydrokinetic energy), rhythm of the gait of the snapping of nodules in my foot (plantar fibromatosis (Ledderhose disease) is a benign hyperproliferative disorder of the plantar aponeurosis presenting as one or more firmly globular slow-growing plaques on the plantar surface of the medial fascia of the foot (the etiology is unknown (correlations are common to trauma (the interragator is beating on the soles of the foot with thick rubber gardenhose) & liver disease & diabetes mellitus & epilepsy & alcoholism)), histopathological examination of plantar fibromatosis is revealing dense fibrocellular tissue with parallel and nodular arrays of fibrocytes & fibrillar collagen with a distinctive corkscrew morphology) interiorly clicking with other physiological rhythms (the microscopic imperfections of the circulatory system & neuronal noise (stochastic oscillations in pacemaker neurons are glitching the interior forestnoise of metronomes) & respiration & stomach acid & my aortic stenosis & the grinding creeping of the bowel movement across the plicae circulares brushing its rind with tender villi (gentle microvilli) & each footfall is knocking together the teeth & each footfall is misshaping the eyeball), routing a strolling distraction through Tsentergrad linking the studios of the sleepless writers making something from nothing is the celebration of fluid in the city along riverrun & waterflow vivisecting (Neva (Bolshaya Neva & Malaya Neva) & Moyka & Strelka &

quays & embankments and prospekts returning to the gulf, in the eddies are the lamplight tendrils from the collection of high windows, curtaining the parlor window, a signalling configuration in the window, accidentally pulling the drapery in front of the floorlamp, the parlor is warmly dimming a warm glowing fabric panel, my decaying orbiting the apartment is continuing, the nightsky white cotton fluffiness (the kind of softness I'm associating with packing the mouth of a corpse or a kidnapping victim (malevolent flocculence)) is capturing luminance from all over Tsentergrad (from lake to gulf, from Novgorod to Karelia) into a uniform featureless flat glowing distribution accumulating lamplight on writing desks (Pushkin, Akhmatova, Blok, (Joseph) Brodsky, Nabokov, Dostoevsky, Gogol, Granin, Chukovsky, Dovlatov, Naiman, Rein, Marinina, Belyaev, Simonov, Leskov, Gippius, Polonsky, Maykov, Grigorovich, Pleshcheyev, Veinberg, Saltykov, Kuzmin), the pallor of the dewy aeration of vaporous haziness is distinctly telegraphing the atmospheric qualities of each lightsource, the bisection of physical operations necessary throttling the perceptions is not the disruption or isolation of physicochemical interactions but the slowing of (or more precisely the dilation of (or scaling of)) the observational mechanisms, the perceptual increments (events) that are comprising a complex scenario are containing increments that are imperceptible from scalar perspectives in either direction (as a human I'm incapable of seeing the entirety of the earth spinning & the dimunition of an electron orbiting), these increments are not corresponding to the physical composition of the event but to the focal resolution of the observational mechanism, the best example of this is the housefly whose <<Scintillation Fusion Threshold>> (its counterpart <<Critical Scintillation Frequency>> is the tunable aspect) quadruple that of my <<SFT>> meaning the housefly is perceiving my palm swooping toward it 25% slower than I am perceiving it, the same physical operation is existing in multiple flowstates, all of my actions are striving for triumphant materiality, am I human, is a human not capable of inert objectness, the conundrum in my aspiration to traversing these flowstates in myself is the separation of psychophysics from physicochemistry by striving for inhuman objectivity (detachment from the cultural ), I'm making of myself an instrument, three men in coveralls in a spraybooth are painting a long metal table a dark enough gray that is not black but is downplaying bloodstaining, slotting across the cornice of the tabletop is receiving leather strapping, am I hearing Nadia, by selectively throttling the <<Cognitive Scintillation Frequency>> I am omitting the luminance and admitting the audio and toggling to the cloudlight of a streetlamp is reflecting off Anna is standing outside the Kresty prisongates (where she is waiting on information about my imprisonment (where she is waiting on information about the imprisonment of her son)) translating the softness of her cheek into the strength of her nose into a wavering afterimage in the sky, in her undressing the sternal extremity of her clavicle a crescent moon in the nightlight, imprisonment is an extensive pall, torturing in custody, tacit acceptance is mycelium rottingly devouring the morality of every citizen is reaching out from the crypts hundreds of feet below the Bolshy Dom (1km north of the Anna Akhmatova Museum on Liteyniy Ave), throttling is necessitating cognitive tweening of perceptual scintilla where the perceptual vacancy is needing stimuli, three men in coveralls are pushing me into an areaway with a gentle curvature chuting into a cell beneath the Bolshy Dom directly onto a metal table, humanvoices inside mortar inside massive concrete, entrusting tremendous spiritual action to words is the artifice of the daemon, words are fidelitous to their inertness (humanvoices waking them and they are drowning), my analysis of the assassination of Ktiya is existing only (for my personal documentation of its elegantly contradictory thickness) for its existence as documentation of a masslike event (each increment of the projectile from gunmuzzle (resting on its trajectory against each hair is singeing against the blunt meplat is flat against the scalpskin) inaccessible from any other event, the focalpoint of my efforts is the methodical construction of an argument on the basis of chirality, persuasion is uninteresting (in honesty it is despicable (words are only persuasive with the weight of a real human presence (most advantageous is oration) from whom their rendering is as transient & formless stimuli)) to me, aspirations toward persuasion are dooming both author & reader, an edifice of false expectations within which the stakeholders are meandering & staring with ineffectual mightiness whereas the static & enduring text is a nurturing edifice (upon which no expectations are bearing) that we humans are in adjacency with never collocating with never affecting, artificial strength versus no apparent strength, the wholesale societal faith in the mystery of symbolism is a crucial trait of the suppressive regime, symbolism is the illusion of potential is a place where the richness of our consciousness is taking flight but it is where the regime is enforcing the notion that the truth of communication is ephemeral and subjective to fluctuating cultural outlooks is manipulatable, investment in the truth (chirality) of a text is on the basis of rejection of the symbolic claptrap coalescing around the poetic construction of an argument, the gesturousness of an argument in text is inherently absent is lurking beneath is a dolphin swimming through a cresting wavebreaking (not sharing form but sharing location (one aspect definitive of figuration the other definitive of spirit)), I'm not precise in the way that the administration is expecting precision, I've an inability for developing clarity, it isn't an affectation and if anything my belligerent intellectual schema is a rationalization of that inability, it's my belief that it is a very effective characterization of the schismatic complications (acknowledging (capitalizing upon) rather than smoothing over the disruptions) of our communal reality, is the basic concept & execution of the navmesh not inviting of florid script is it not the underlayment of byzantine calligraphic movement across the ADAemone (across the undifferentiation of physical terrain), autos are inscribing these tales across the mesh, I am precise within the overall schema of my behavior, even my language is necessarily precise, but my particular assimilation of the Acmeist schema is requiring a precision that is alienating, where every coastline is infinite men are dying on their knees living entire lifespans counting & cataloging & dimensioning grains of beachsand, every tree is not just its species & location but the entire catalog of statuses for its ecosystem & physiognomy throughout the endurance of its fluid existence, there is always more to fit in (cavities (the puddles & lakes & rivers of forcejustification are magnetic to my stylus) yawning) between, every characteristic existing at every scalar platform is home to an internal collection needing description & definition & articulation & documentation, accretion is truly human, we are builders not dreamers (lying immobile in an opium den), we are making things less & less human that we are standing apart from and considering, we are a species profiting from our discernment of contrasting, nothing is more opaquely bewitching than the objective qualities of unrelatable & deferrable & unknowable (interminably chasing a vista (resisting the abstraction of interpolation)) events, destruction of the imagination is the true liberation, here is everything, the predication of the administration is upon the panacea of imagination that there is numinousness within everything in order to cope with the constraints of the orchestration of the administration of life, nothing is more powerful than objective scrutiny, intellectual microscopy, nothing is more beautiful than the endless depth of a pixelating pixel, if a text is visualizable as a terrain it is tweenable, expanding the dimensionality of figurespace & thinspace & parenspace for the insertion of entire text nestings, the inscription of realizations of full compositions in the whitespace of letter characters (Acounter & Bcounter (within the BBowl) & Dcounter (within the Dbowl) & Ocounter & Pcounter & Qcounter & Rcounter & acounter & bcounter (within the bbowl) & dcounter (within the dbowl) & ecounter & gcounter & ocounter & pcounter & qcounter), is there no terminal, no there is no terminal in either scalar direction, the potential is going down & down (in) and up & up (out), describing this methodology (thickening (or invagination) is the scalar manipulation of the observer to all aspects of the physical world, the tendency is assignation of the spatiality (this is indeed the best terminology accepting the notion of expansiveness (being a medium) and its independence from the objectness of things like odors & luminance & soundwaves (the volume of a bookobject is of special interest to thickening in that it is an increment that is oscillating between medium & object that at the particular scale where it is presenting an image of clarity and definitiveness (though as a cuboid it is geometrically (topologically) identical to a brick a book is possessing a distinctive spatiality not only through the recursive unfurling of its pagination but through the intronautic deferral of the infinitude of its text content) it is full of combinatory potential as an object through arrangement on bookshelves or stacking or piling in infinitely variable quantities and entropic status (where contingent aspects such as dimensional ratios & coloration & binding type & cover finish & pagecutting & wear status are creating vast interleavings of information permutations) at a scalefactor that is willfully jettisoning the content of each book (although with the knowledge that a book is a book the projection of its potential into any heaping of volumes is unavoidable (up to a certain scale at which the bookness of the increment is still legible (a planetoid pixelated together from books seen through a weak telescope in earthbondage is nothing more than a blurry blotch))))) inherent in thickening to the five human sensations however this is misrepresenting the nonphysical nature of the process, an example of this is microscopy where the pivotal distinction is that microscopy is the scaling up of scalarly obscurant regions for admittance into our sensory processing, unlike microscopy thickening is the actual diminishment of the observer (not the human, I am not suggesting that the human body is scaling down to explore the caverns of a molecule (I'm admitting this is fascinating (<<Fantastic Voyage>> or <<Microscopia>> or <<Viaggio allucinante>> (<<a fantastic & spectacular odyssey through the human body into the brain>> or <<an odyssey into the living body of a human male>> or <<four men & one woman on the most fantastic & spectacular & terrifying odyssey of their

<<The Killing Violin>>))), the ideal descriptor of the observer is <<cognition>> (a (static) cognition (not the consciousness))) as the slowing of an active processing is disingenuous or misrepresenting the physics of it), inbetweening or <<tweening>> is more accurate where the framerate is in disengagement with the constraints of human perception (the nature of the biological apparatuses of human perception and the ways those organs are composing our Weltanschauung) but to more orthodox methodist ontology (not of the occult (by omission (or the administrative posture that there is (within that inaccessible data) a mysterious truth)) data intrinsic to the Brownian instability and radioactive decayal of the platter crystallography (and by extension the precise eigenstate of all Golgi artifacts)) investing in the crucial meaninglessness (the <<Acmeist>> ontology) of the physical eigenstate, that it is existing (on the basis that its local sampling is manageable with an

<<navmesh>> is disseminating the diverging myopias of the pedestrian into increasingly narrowing possibilities (geometric doldrums) diminishing to an accidental destination where the pedestrian is a

although the bipedal nature of human gaits are characterizing the rhythmic system of the gait in quaternary (each shoe on/off in contacting the concrete), the sole of one shoe is never in a simple

the toe that are each hopping and planting across the concrete (unless the stroller is a tippytoe walker)) the sole is superficially contacting the concrete twice & the noncontacting shoe is

the biological rhythm of the gait is undecimal with a radix of eleven footsteps per <lineation> is hendecasyllabic (endecasillabo) is (11 being prime) an indivisible unit or body that in combination with a stylistic engarbment formally analogous to <terza rima> although lacking the meaning associatable with language (is necessarily replacing the mnemonic & aesthetic functionality of rhyming with ornamentally balletic micromovements) is linking a unital body to the others in the family of the dÃ©rive in breathingly propulsive interconnection, I'm slipping into the inversion of these chasms whose floor (a chokingly stuttering trickling streaming rivulet) is our collective concurrence in the fount of perception, even in the most peaceful and serene situation the human perceptional suite is transmitting a drowning glut of information on a very narrow frequency, waterdroplets splishing up from collisions with small stones cropping out of the streamingness communing with the air lofting into the widening crosssection of the chasm, every droplet of lifewater cycling through the rivulet is (in one of its cyclings through the chasm) vaporizing into updrafting currents and in the expansion of the chasm volume are dissipating to lower concentrations proportional to the crosssectional width of the chasm, that creation is avoidance is a reasonable assertion, it is a more contestable assertion that tweening knowns is creation (even though the poles of the exercise are given there is some latitude in the interpolative process), from any perspective it is liberation of the mind from the body,
