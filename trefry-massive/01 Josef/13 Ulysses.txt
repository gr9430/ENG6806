luminance of the lighthouse at the rivermouth of the Neva, by the luminance of bioluminance from her fingertips Anna from an entire sea away is recognizable (in mostly darkness) is Anna my Anna Neva on a bench over the quay reading in French, <<Finnegans guet de la mort>>, pageleaves partings, in my sensations Anna is in the sunlight behind Payriteskip, we are kissing without touching, from an entire lifetime away it is literature and more precisely the impossibility of language (Anna Neva is not utilizing French or Italian or Spanish (Anna Neva is speaking in the language of the river)) that is binding us with a desire not for physical touching but for the pooling of our consciousness beyond a threshold of corporeality, tu tradira, tu tradira la tua linguaggio, I've vision of beyond that is inseparable from my visions of your visage in the gray dewiness beyond which is your deathmask in a perfect union of the development (unfolding of the 4space) of the hypercubic octahedron onto the human 2stratum of being representationally cubic (a hexagon decomposing into its constituent equilateral triangles), your disappearance is my leaving you, I am certain you are remaining in that location, ADA is the river and you are the stationary metric, it is me sweeping myself away from you Anna into the emptiness of communication and further into the futility of recollection, Anna fu, Neva è, Plurabella sarà, all the rivers of this planet alive in every choking of the capillaries approaching our skin separation by layerings & strata of fabric, such is impossibility, I am dreaming of you, it is a vision of you drawing out my death breath (a cat on my chest), my sister and my mother, saint and whore, reluctantly taking me into your body, respiring liquid, every utterance on your breath is the pollution of my death, we aren't capable of discussing the text only reading it parallel to one another and to the entirety of its reading public even the granite that is devouring it, porting the <<Deathwatch>> into the platter through a ratification tray (it is consequential which particular volume of the <<Deathwatch>> is in transposition (for 1 its existence as a physical artifact is in cancellation (its verification is now lying in the platter and not in its being & for 2 the platter is adopting not just an OCR of its text but every nuance of its typography & paperstock & all aspects of paratext regardless of how subtle or inconsequential) thus any sentimental valuation of inclusion of the bookobject in the tactility & warmth of physical life is vulnerable) is not producing a thorough reading synopsis or armature of our expectations or a translation into a soluable documentation (the formation of such a thing is not visualizable) because it

Anna Neva, altro che, conosciamo tutte Anna Neva, dimmi tutto, e presto presto, roba da chiodi, Joyce himself is translating the Anna component of the <<Deathwatch>> into Italian not with the agenda of fidelity but of mapping the potentiality of Italian on the phonemic metaphorical allusive armature of his original text, ma come suona la torza rima, dalle la stura, farò la scoltenna mentre che trebbio e coi fiocchi i sottovasti del Mincio Minchioni, Brodmann is declaring the <<Deathwatch>> is linguistically unstable primarily because of the precision of its construction, there is a preponderance of interconnectivity that is disabling the vision of its structural construction as a whole and fractally decomposing new micronations of serifim deeper & more inchoate, every text is unstable in this way, no text has an eigenstate to the reader, according to Brodmann the reading of the <<Deathwatch>> is experiencing a combination of agnosia typologies (akinetopsia (or the inability of seeing visual motion), astereognosis (or the inability of tactilely identifying quotidian artifacts), morphological agnosia (or the inability of perceiving the entirety of an artifact only its minutiae), pure alexia (or the inability of recognizing text), simultagnosia (the inability of processing visual input of a whole only piecemeal increments)) manifesting in a confluence of aspects a quality indistinguishable from silence, the ideal status of human creation is plausible deniability of its existence (the zenith of such antiaspirations being the 500 puzzlepaintings (each a watercolor rendering of a foreign seaport that (with the development of a special mastic) is laminating to a backerboard which is disassembling into a jigsawpuzzle which upon assembly is dissolving in the seaport of its depiction) of Percival Bartlebooth whose (are all deaths not sudden) death with 61 puzzlepaintings remaining for dissolution is igniting competing advocations of preservation versus annihilation (prompting, at the direction of conceptual completist Jsief Alpinist a <<Project956 Sarych (or buzzard)>> destroyer (<<Burny>> (or <<Impetuous>>)) mooring in the Canal de Bourbourg of Dunkirk is firing a <<P270 Mosquito>> missile (240km strikingdistance) is targeting 11 rue Simon-Crubellier in Paris is instead striking the grave of André Breton and flinging his casket fully intact onto the gravesite of Pavel Milyukov)), Morodor is suggesting that the <<Deathwatch>> is more conducive to translation than <<Bleak Dwelling>> or <<Challenging Temporalities>> and Eco is concurringly pronouncing it <<the easiest text for translation as it is providing maximum creative liberty>>, Eco is adding that the <<Deathwatch>> is a plurilingual text conceivingly sonorous in its native language is devouring all languages although committing only to the lingua franca of the author (or the translator (for whom such sqwaukings are in their lingua franca (where the lingua franca is intra not inter (a <<lingua interiore>>)) and mappable to the armature of the <<Deathwatch>> (or the <<veglia al letto di un moribundo>> or the <<privegherea morții>> or the <<halálvirrasztás>> or the <<guet de la mort>> or the <<predsmertnoye bdeniye>>))) for sqwauking out puns & allusions onto a substrate of metaphorical lath (in the proportions (3:1 (radius:height)) of the platter) whose grain is a tesselation of sweatsoakingly oneiric unfoldings of the tesseract (261 unfoldings (or developments) of the tesseract only 5 are suitable for isometric spacefilling (where the assumption that the voxelization of infinity is ideally cubic the <<Deathwatch>> (Terrence McKenna is estimating that the <<Deathwatch>> is containing at least 63,000 distinct words (whereas <<The Feats of Alice through the Looking Glass>> by Lewis Carroll is containing 2766 distinct words & <<Pride and Prejudice>> is containing 6424 distinct words & <<A Tale of Two Cities>> is containing 9877 distinct words & <<Oliver Helix>> is containing 10,419 distinct words & <<A Connecticut Yankee in the Sovereignty of King Arthur>> is containing 10,312 distinct words)) is approximately 40x40x40 voxels (where the tesseract development is containing 8 voxels (in 3 strata utilizing the <<SpaltenTechnik>>)) or 7,875 tesseracts)) more spacious in its potential than the mechanical reproduction of the text itself such that upon its completion its physical existence is inessential, there is no more metaphorically congruent linkage to Anna than an expendable superfluity whose meaning is essentially the indistinct entirety of consciousness, the rivering hydrology of hitherandthithering hydrology of opaquely impenetrable daylight shroudingly she is emergingly fingertips only waving a volume of text pulling forth her rarely smiling face -- We are Both Reading The Same Text -- a circularly discussable text that we are needn'tly discussing as a discussion of the text more that our reading of the <<Deathwatch>> in any setting with or apart from each other is a cobordism, I've the image of a flexible worldsheet upon which is the Anna & I together by the Neva under the lighthouse on a bench that in its deformation is my cold birth and my death on Daemonaz wasting away in the frigid bleak but as a component of this warmth and intellectual awakening into the fecund potentiality of the phoneme the text fragmentation is cunniformly invaginating on this flexible membrane such that every component of text is mapping onto any other component of text while retaining its more broadly allusive or metaphorical or punny material, I am saying -- Everything We are Saying is Something Else -- is mappable onto some other substrate of our intentions, -- My Adoration Of You is Infinite -- , <<John 10:14>>, -- You are My Snuffling Lambkin In Perpetuity -- these are the mechanics of all secretive communications, just enough sentimental truth within a kernel of exploding obfuscation, when people say <<this artistic work is a loveletter to artistic work>> what they are saying is this person likes to eat their own ass, an expression or any component of an expression is the entirety of expression, building a life with another person is reducing the necessity of complex language or reducing the necessity of superficially transparent language, during complete & thorough immersion into a language scenario its external mycelial mesh (the allusive and metaphorical context of a text in human culture) is vaguing, an observable threshold is developingly occluding any external referentiality or utility, the threshold is contracting around a kernel of singular ineluctable vaporous warmth of nonsenseness (Nonhosonno), gazing, rubbing bookcovers together, scissoring in lieu of bookmarks, are there enough joyeaux in living for justifying its duration, distillation of the text is in actuality an additive procedure, a simple text is far too vast because it is lacking internal friction for developing its bespoke meaning system, only in unfettering the complication & internal frictioning of a text is it developing clarity, an entire existence (insect or tree or human or universal entirety) is irreducible, the fallacy of the ADA (one fallacy of the ADA) is that the cogneme is containing no useful information without the constellation of its useless plurality of its cognitive morass, on the bench at the edge of the earth under the lighthouse through fogginess (are we concurrently) discussing is afoot on whether it is a necessity that the <<Deathwatch>> is a

movie with static functionality and forcing the notion of meaning into a zone that is unbecoming of art or any medium of communication, every communication involves a quantity of translation, the most pivotal decisions in a translation are those underlying its constraints not local semantics, a poem is not an affidavit, every utterance is propulsively prompting a subsequent utterance or action in not more of the same and not accretion but supersession in a sequential or collocational replacement of the predicating event (utterance), the predication is accessible via cobordism but is (ideally) not existing contemporaneously with its superseder, comparison between two mediums is futile, <<A Cock and Bull Story>> is metaphorically <<The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman>> &
