the oscillation of the eccentriccrank is mechanically operating a pumping mechanism is forcing vaguely nutritive slurry--<<Total Parenteral Sustenance „TPS“>>--from an armature outside through the aluminian tissue, manto slurry deposition decayal withering the skin and softening the meatless fascia is grating the ribcage into bonemeal against pocky aluminum, the young boy in coveralls is cutting the coastline perimeter of Daemonaz Island into a pressboard pegboard panel for the ADA cartographer is receiving a pegboard simplification of the coastline of Daemonaz Island from his assistant who is attaching a plumbline from a hole in the pegboard and inscribing its vector down across the panel and through a series of plumbline vectors in a variety of orientations is finding the centroid of the island on which the cartographer is delineating <<Daemonaz Island transitcamp>> on his official chart, nauseating coldness rushing into the apartment <<massive>> without my overcoat, ADA greatcoat draping over the small bookshelf concealing the man is rifling through is peeling brittle endpapers from the books with the apex of a dagger is pointing into our crockery and cookware--Nadia miserably darkly laughingly weeping at what the ADA goon is imagining of my stealth for concealing a 200pp article manuscript in a teacup--and the absence of food is scopically limiting is ransacking to prying apart the laminations of plywood cabinet doors and drawing the dagger through caulking between precast concrete wallpanels & dissecting the foamy backer rod extractingly uncoiling across the matte floor--I'm genuinely fearful of his cutting away her scalp & pounding open Nadia's skull with the pommel of his dagger & transcribing the honest light of facsimile projecting from the crater--and he is standing like a tent in his greatcoat in front of the door where two other goons in coveralls are entering for my bodily apprehension all oblivious to their quarry--my article is lying in the lid of a paperbox methodically stackingly and collating its cover page is stating <<Letter to the Daemon Concerning the Assassination of Ktiya>> in fullbleed elegant reversecontrast handlettering--are removing me from my dwelling in the <<massive>> on Missuri Boulevard blackout Nadia grayspace filtration away from her bodily safekeeping into shellgame with skulls full of blackblood draping itchy black wool pericranium cannot luminance cannot relief, is rhythm a possibility without sequentiality of events but in a static arrangement across which the notation of or indexing of aspirationally rhythmic constructions is perceptible yet is requiring an imaginitive insertion of movement or possibility of parallax against which relative positioning is gaugeable from one rhythmic body to a benchmark in the distance, the event is finite in one axis and expansive beyond comprehension or beyond necessity on the planarity, the entire topography of my body is contacting other bodily--pilingly crushingly cannot breathingly wheezing gravitational additive constriction--with no sensation only analytically surveying the wafering of negativespace, touchingly contactpoints are sensations of analysis, not valuable to the imagination, cannot sensation with the kneecap, cannot movement, restraint by crushingly deadweight of my people cannot respiration, provision for hermetically looping oxygen production in each cell of the ingot, cannot vision, I'm not desirous of visual, screaming is muffling, the leathery wings of the <<Poinai>> vibrating in a fringing softly sounding formation of drakoni vomiting molten aluminum, macro I'm seeing the grain of fabric cakingly dirtshit scabbiness living organisms with minimal overhead clearance are preparing the surface with the devourment of organic materials with the properties antagonistic to the bondage of molten aluminum to flesh, moth larvae are eating the fibers in our thin clothing, I'm away from the dwelling without an overcoat bartering for tea beneath a dark window, lamplight in the window, apprehension on the sidewalk, Nadia's shoulderblades against the window, my

the bodypile the adjustment of posing is tantalizing but impossibly stiff cramping is not unpleasant nostalgia of the musculature constraining with crushing liquefaction of aluminum at 1680.67°R in a freezing gale proving the deixis of burning through flesh--dermis, adipose, musculature, skeletal exposure eschar--, conditional flesheating molten metal is cooling into an ingot of casting medium in the negativespace of the bodypile, clothing burning, lacy clothing of moth devourment, the skeleton of the cavernicolous exilee is lying in the depressions of its aluminum body chamber, pooling of Geotrichum candidum penetration into porous aluminum casting, in a railyard overlooking Lake Baikal fecal diagnostic panels from ballvalve tapping phreatic zone liquid of the nutritive tissue is draining into clinical tubes, exilee urine treatment in the <<Urine Processor Assembly „UPA“>> is commingling with condensate recovery in the slurry vessel, penetrative Sarma gales of the CircumBaikal swayingly freezingly and thawingly artesian slurry vesicle, diarrhea cannot consciousness, contrarily the existence of the bodyheap in infinite events across the steppe is not the existence of the bodyheap stationary in each event is not me with some enduring proximity to Nadia to familiarity or stability, exilation is not a radial concept of further and further exilation is a recentering and exilation from the refreshing of each centerpoint, not the distancing of the exilee from homeplace but annihilation of the very acknowledgement of homeplace as a geographic ideal, erasure of a locus of hopefulness, ceaselessly wailing, each homeplace each investment in stasis is precipice encampment crumblingly tumbling down the sloughing of the mountainside glimpsing all of the appealing crags and pinnacles recognizing nothing and fog enshrouding the mountaintop is there a mountaintop or are we lying in the debrisfield of a crater, skyvault of oilcloth, vaulting fabric of the sky is flutteringly indexically is fraying webby gauzy snowfall and snowmelt through the distantly threadbare occulus the aluminization of kevlar mittens--leather palms & wool lining--, fibrous falling threadbare mountainside is whispering to the geometric cascading with dividers and the spotlight is flaring a tangibly stellate figuration above the patentleather visor of the «Commandant» is floating

deictic thermal burning is dependent on the air temperature although damaging the dermis at a minimum is unavoidable, vection, lingual screaming through the tissue, death wheezy whispering breathly clicking through the tissue, the irregular breathing of weeping, deferral of domestic uncertainty is the construction of a chord & the compassing from the endpoints of the chord with equal radii whose interlinking intersections are serving as the endpoints of a radicalline whose intersection is finding the centerpoint of the chord & through which is the construction of a perpendicular diameter & construction of a second chord utilizing the identical construction such that the two diameters are intersecting at the centerpoint, new centerpoint new radius inscription new chord attempts new location, the stellate figuration luminously sloughing to the paper Drakolastcok is the location for exilation and involuntary railcar transporter entombment in molten aluminum is casting in the negativespace between exilees where a looseweave of waxpaper straws are weavingly casting a xylemic conduit tissue, warmly female voice hesitantly is describing her emotional connection to human cadavers crosslamination with tinny reverberant yelling woman, food slurry is pumping into the vesicle between skin over ribcage and aluminum casting medium pooling food slurry is freezingly pulling

sliming cannot eyelid, waxpaper ignition metalsmoke & pyrolyzation of aluminian cenospheres & lingual pyrography, anchialine poolings salting the hydrology of the sky is raining corrosion on the

ballvalve tappings for fluid drainage--inversely at the top of the tissue network for fluid injection--is flooding liquid gallium through the tissue is promoting molecular embrittlement of the shattering aluminum casting bodies scattering across the shakingtable are scrambling across the flat platform clawing and covering their eyes throwing themselves from the platform to the dirt terminal burrowing into the hard soil going nowhere are scraping their faces against gravel back and forth into a growing crater filling with blood drowning in blood, the auto transporter is ferrying away
