running its course through smoother water, the small bark of this block is hoisting its sail, leaving that cruelly ebbing sea behind,

I am singing, climbing against the dark and hidden stream to constellations familiar in their softness though foreign in the drift of  uncanny  mirroring—the upward cleansing—arisingly, with the accompaniment of miserable magpies, listen, -- I am Yours Calliope -- ,

four fresh stars glittering asterismally tetrahedronal are pouting even through the perpetual blond aurora of the globe pate, I am escaping monodirectionally to the impermanent north, every woman there a widow, every man is sucking into the soil, most antipodes are lying in the sea, the secret crux of rumors is that escaping is falling away from the earth into the stars,

the aurora is consuming nettles are growing in soft pliant mud against a fence, and racing away from its tumescence the dim--cloaking the soft sea waves with the knowledge of tremulous sunsneak,

the sun is becoming visible only at the horizon underneath the pelt of thick red vapors, following a sagittal plane along to the obscurity of its fleecy zenith,

as we are tarrying by the seashore, those others are thinking about the way to travel and the ideal path, and in their hearts are following this path, while their bodies are still lingering among us,

the aspect of the silhouettes is of emptiness, though a body fleshingly receiving planetshine, I am embracing the fabric of my own coat in attempting and attempting and attempting to grasp them,

the thorough monomaniacal consumption of pleasure or of pain is swelling out all other sensations or aspirations, the doctrine that a humor is perpetually triumphant is erroneous, the error is liberatory, in the bondage concentration of the rapturous humor is the soaring and stolid separateness of the others are immaterial are spacelike, measureless and ignorant of any human demanding or desiring,

we are climbing into a crevice is closing in around us necessitating our hands into the concrete joints stabilizing our footing,

we are human, if you are «Virgil», and for no other failing are we in this purgation but our lack of originality,

we have no fixation to a particular place and are offering as much guidance as necessary, particularly in the dark of night the body is not moving and the consciousness is manifesting fearsome possibilities in its stead, the eyes are roaming over a dim morass with no set divisions are searching for a true beginning, submission to the spinning is not without pleasure, because surplus is overcoming simplicity,

with fixation on the coordinates specifying their ostensible diametrically wheeling--though truly centerless, lacking equidistance, possessing only an axial midpoint--elliptical bases, both the seat of Sion and the structure we are climbing are finials on the odd cromniomorphic domes of earth whose great circular seam is not the zero latitude but another greatcircle whose planar horizon is razorly cutting adrift Oceania cohemispherically with the west frontier of the Daemones--Up Daemone and Down Daemone--from the Ecumene and the subservient east frontier of the Daemones, both pinnacles gazing at one another under the lobbing intervals of the solar autostrada,

in the manner we are rotating--replacing each other and leaving chaff of our tracings settling down compellingly toward the greater body--itself frizzling onward onward--in the spatial grain of the caster wheeling onward about the sidewalls of the single nominal greatcircle of that globular motion, in Daemonic parlance «the „seam“», never biasing a season, in its seeming equilibrium never protracting or contracting the rhythm of night and not night, 

«Continue your ascent, you with such naively persisting belief, but the daemone is not letting me through the tollgate, when from the last breath of my own air, when far too late, sighing my hollow penance, my unforgiven expiration, now I am waiting until the stars realign with those of my birth firmament, unstable and uncorrelatable--some factors of the matrices are correlating, while others, such as distance and refraction are not, though tentative on reference spheres with expansive radii and disparate centroids rotating lush sheaths--which alignments I wonder, never will the registration full recall, parhaps it is just an asterism of salvation, or it is something inside me, it is night at home, but merely hazeluminous elsewhere,»

«I am „Virgil“, and my failing of faithlessness is costing me heaven»

«I am under no ADA sequestrations on this particular terrain, you see me ascending and moving about, within my geopermissions I am your accompaniment and I am guiding you, but not in darkness»

a valley luminous with dandelion such that against the importation of intricate sculpture in gold and fine silver, daubs of carmine and leaden white on glass pictureplane, spraying indigo dye upon the breeze, the celestial black of lignite bright and clear, marquetry of emeralds in twain, all in juxtaposition such that the dell is subduing their brightness against the colors of grass and flowers, more is overcoming less,

«the worth of the folks is infrequently rising through the nettles, and as only the ADA is willing ascent, it is in the ADA the folks are seeking it»

the queue to the tollgate is drawing closer to a cleft in the polymer stuccorendering wall where a gate--in two pieces flanking a fasces trumeau--atop three stairtreads--each of a different color--is under the surveillance of a silent «apparator» in humble coveralls the colorless color of arid ash, the first stairtread is of pure white reflective marble in which both «apparator» and queue are appearing incidentally to one another, the second stairtread is stone of an apparent coloration without identifiable hue in transcendence of hadal indigo, the third stairtread is spurting arterial blood from its haemophiliac porphyry looming chafingly above, the daemonic «apparator» is resting both of his jackboots on the dark threshold unswerving from its magnetite,

the queue is drawing upon the «apparator» at the gate, in armslength proximity rising from a wood stool with his hand under the hair on the tender muscle spanning the occipital of the «aspirant»--with the other hand clasping the heel of an engraver's burin--is prefunctorily tracing a block pattern of 7 Ps on my forehead with a threetier dropcap flanking three rows of two with the declaration to each -- Once You are Inside, Once You are Free Of These Seven Predispositions, See That You are Washing Away These Wounds --

with the principal of the queue--dabbing at her forehead where blood is collecting in her thin eyebrows--facing the numinous gate between the jambs between his reaching arms from his coveralls the «apparator» is withdrawing a silver key with rote though delicate intensity is actuating the silver lock and is withdrawing a gold key from his coveralls gingerly precious in his hand is nonchalantly actuating the gold lock whispering as the gate is swinging open -- If These Keys Should Fail To Actuate The Lock The Gate Does Not Open -- 

pushing one leaf of the gate open the «apparator» is saying -- «Aspirant», You are Entering, However, I am Warning You That The «Entrant» Who Is Looking Back To The Outside is Halting And Returning To The Outside With The Stripping Of Their «Propiska» -- with vibratto accompaniment of the metal linchpins rotation inside the knuckles of their hingeleaves, and groaning with the heaviness of the gate swinging is the strident shrieking of silence is the body slumping away from the blank stone of execution,

crossing the tollgate threshold lockbolts actuating resoundingly plunking into their wells all around the jamb are of such rhythmic temptation the temple and ear of the fresh «entrant» are cocking quizzically back toward the racket are freezing and facing back to the path ahead--comparatively confining in a waveform crevice with no axial directionality--porous with ebbing certainty,

issuing from the crevice «Virgil's» assurance in the urban thickness has limitations--he is a fresh «entrant» just as well, although--being an ambulatory cadaver--with less liability--we are stopping at a flat and desolate piazza upon the shady apron of concrete «massives'» windowless facades recessively battering, 

where the limbonic are weeping and yearning an angel appearing before us engravingly vivid and graciously is turning the key to a celestial portal--not the cerulean of false stucco but deep placidity beyond jetsamlace is alien azure--of seawater in suspension above the terrace through which she is breaching her beak, echoing «you are beholding the handmaid of the sea», her comportment hanging in the liquid ceiling is a subtle embossment more liquid than body, 

slow foot grinding is audible crunching in the loose gravel amidst the aberration of freestanding marble encrustations--their humanity becoming apparent in pale musculature and proportions developable from crushing deformity--immobile beneath an outcropping cliff whose bases firmly bearing but twisting in slow rotation for stability against the burdenment of the architrave and mountainous pediment, I'm not relating this for terror, or for the swerving of intrinsic faith, because although the corbelling condemnation of the caryatid or atlantid is one of indescribable suffering, it is against the continually adjacent threshold of execution into the disintegral bosom of annihilation,

worms slithering through the eye of the tollgate are beholden--just inside the perimeter and without any indulgence in the beneficence of the city--to fearfully rearing hydrostatically up to the restraints of the crumbling architrave withering their lepidopterous antennae in the impulsive reaction of selfpreservation freezing them in that location and the upright worms beside them whispering -- I am Not Going On -- splattering beneath a cascade of granite, and although it is an enclosure and it is civilization and it is a city--by the definition of a masscollective dwellingplace--it is not my city nor is it even my waystation,

ghosts weighing down their spectral raiments with gastroliths and suckingstones--those weighing down the soaring oneiric spirits striving against trudging--in the peerlessness of their trauma, are purging away the darkness of the world,

molluscs weighing down their ordinarily burdensome bodies with the sick flesh of the daemon--its saturation of black bile sopping--are asking in the street -- Show Me The Shortest Way To The Basilica, With The Fewest Stairs, Or, If All Ascents are Equal, The Ascent With The Sturdiest Guardrails -- because mercy is for those climbing slowly but deliberately, 

-- They are Scrutinizing The Tendencies & Fabrications Of Your Intellect, The Retaliatory Action Of Those <<Black Gulphs>> Among Your Molluscky Townspeople--Violently And Vindictively Reacting To The Complexity And Contradiction Inherent In Cultural Productions Beyond The Scope Of Their Expectations--is The Most Accurate Metric Of Their Intentions -- 

following the gait of my psychopomp fervescently reinforcing the buoyancy of our ascent -- For Reassurance That You are Not Floating Away, Downcast Your Gazing On The Roadbed --

VOM, LVE,

the stonework of the spiralling roadway is extruding pensive & holy granite outcroppings of upright inhuman corpses are headstones for their own gravesites more accurate in their resemblance than a subtly naturalistic rendering, the soulfulness of virginal boulder is drawing forth grievingly copious lachrymosity, pricklingly spurring halcyon imagery of the dead,

the decapitation of Cyrus slurpingly in a canopic jar full of blood, -- You are Thirsty For Blood, are you Licking It Up -- the neckstump of Holofernes gushing the righteously bloodthirsty leavings of his slaughterful ruination,

the dead are living, the living are dead, Saint Minias is headfirst leading us across the Ponte alle Grazie into the swirlingly precipitous hillscapes, the disembodiment of singsong vocalizing -- Beati Pauperes Spiritu -- is further unburdening my body--even in the arduous ascent of the granite stairway--to increasingly delightful effortlessness, fingerspreading my righthand across my forehead to the discovery of my relinquishing the inscription of one of the 7 Ps,

at the precipice of the staircase the exculpatory mountain is shouldering back into a tighter second concentric radius,

the technical terminology of falconry,

the sun on its ballistic trajectory toward the horizon, between vespers and midnight, the accute altitude of sunlight battering our ascent up the western frontage of the mountain is overwhelming my vision with the brilliant amplification of incidentally flashing sunlight from the mirrorfinish of stillwater,

an abruptly ecstatic vision, the nave of the Basilica full of people awaiting a woman--with the reassuring warmth of a mother--who is standing just outside the large western doorway,
