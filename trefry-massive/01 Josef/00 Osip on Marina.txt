-- Across A Thousand Kilometers Lying Between Us You are Take This Kissing Tenderness From Me -- vague sensations of mouthlip disembodiment grazing the fine hairs of my nape, Marina is an acroamatic ghost in a corporeal human, an administrative ghost only existing because of the establishment of her existence, lying beside her on the pallet our kneecaps touching through despondent outerwear is separating us by entire cityscapes on diverging autotrains racing outward from the tristesse of Tsentergrad -- It is Suitable We are Apart -- the column of black luminosity is tunneling through my skin and parting my organs is massaging the musculature on the anterior facade of my spine and flushing the interstitial fluid compartment with black luminous liquid flushing through the bloodbrain barrier inking my brain black floating in a black liquid casing is protecting the brain from trauma & exposure to any withering luminance from the sallow parchment lampshades in her attic garret atop the steep wood staircase is aligning with a dormer window behind thick vague thickly recondite heavy arcane heavily abstruse formidable acroamatically wearisome opaque velvet drapery whose informal & inconsistently stochastic pleatings are clutching blackshadow in their burgundy black Lyons velvet stiffness is capturing everything in the respiratory fluid of Marina gasping on the floor next to Alya in her bassinet with a blanket draped across it to shield her from our tenuously automatic tryst, in the silence of the coital downslope I'm cycling my schema is enervating Marina beyond the sleepy malaise of the comedown in my screed on destiny, lying back on the deerskin at the top of the stairs I am consumptive with the crushing of the blackness of Marina and her fluids are swallowing me sinking into tarpit entrapment, solubilizing my fingertips on her melancholy tongue drenching lysozyme is lysing my epidermis down to the compartment of my black intersitial fluid is flowing across her lips and the sluice of her tongue into her own peculiar saliva recipe (cortisol, testosterone, secretory immunoglobulin (or secretory IgA or <<SIgA>>), sodium, potassium, calcium, bicarb, Mg^2+ (a magnesium cation (a divalent metal cation & a monoatomic dication (a cofactor & a geroprotector))), thiocyanate (SCN^− or rhodanide (crystalizing colorless saltiness on my lips)), ammonia, phosphate, mucin, choline, ascorbic acid, glycoprotein, sodium citrate, uric acid, creatinine, cholesterol, lactalylatcal, Na2HPO4 (disodium phosphate), glucose, albumin, alpha-amylase (enzymy reeky in the stubble of my beard), progesterone, estrogen) is folding over & lapping under is a cowlneck or a borehole with the topology of a flatlock junction in the black oxidization of zinc sheetmetal is constructing a small prison cell with vague windows at the apex of the roominghouse Marina and her daughter are starving to death maddeningly siphoning my fluids osmotically into the dry garret, the strangest malady is dying of selfdoubt (the pathology is a thousandfold more savage & more terrifying than physical death) is a subgenre of freezing to death, it is rare, cancer of the bile duct (or cholangiocarcinoma) which is extremely rare is more common, my starvation of adulation is burdening conversations with my wandering down selfdepreciating scenarios to vacant passages awaiting her blandishment -- Josef, My Young Keats, What are You Possibly Learning From My Amateurish Poetry -- but it is not useful in the way I am baiting her for inflation nor in the dismissively supportive manner she is attempting instead the whole game is blanketing us both in shameful performativity, its a cyclical repartee that is filling extents in which both of us are repletely distent with opportunities of being happily solitary sitting at a small writing table I am constructing the intial framework for a methodology of journalistic veracity and the substructures that are facilitating personal narrative or personal predilections without diminishing that veracity is entirely contingent on achiral connective tissue in the situation of an event in the visual corpus of the text (not in the content itself), industriousness is a domain without horizon is a sphere, my preference is being within the innermost pericarp separating me from my self, black on black, highgloss on matte, the construction of a spatial context for lovers (especially itinerant lovers) is an endeavor requiring violent distraction is enhancing the sensation of echolocation with the inamorata as such geometric desirousness is only possible in a flowstate of rote sensation, the dancer is not conscious but alive in a flowing responsiveness to impressions & tensions on her body, she is focusing on her actions and this is what is pulling her out of the sky to crashing on the pavement, everyone is dying from falling from a window but me, I am surviving, what is that is killing me (not slowly (nothing is relational (especially the complex mechanics death (cessation of circulation & brain electrical activity)) or quantifiable by its velocity)), stillness & absence, these preoccupations or conceptions plaguing my trist with Marina are not useful nor are they engaging nor is that their intention, my consciousness is slipping onto a printsurface (similar to a keyboard on a word processor) intermittently impressing a notion that is equivalent to a footprint or the steamy runnel of an asscrack remaining on a hard chair, this is not the refiningly terminal composition of a thoughtful oeuvre for bondage into a tome for carrying around an Italian vacation (reading Henry Miller in the Castelvecchio or <<Das Schloss>> in la Cimitero di Manarola or <<Traumnovelle>> sitting on the Fondamenta de la Misericordia meditating on the myriad striketarget events for swift death in the great stacking of the lifeblock is replete with fractional total deaths at instances of profound guiltiness & sorrow (in such ruthless distillations of an event I am realizing that I've nothing, I'm not possessing at the very least the de minimis of legal mortality much less all of the satellites of living and of the living, putting this another way in the discreteness of an event is holding me in pristine separation from every contributor to my guiltiness to the extent that although death is unnecessary it also is having no bearing on the event)) but the construction of a physical cogneme that is analagous to a Gesamtkunstwerk (a bookobject that is indistinguishable from a piece of furniture whose pageturning is symphonically susurrating (tapering noise of <<Worms Plastic Earthbound>> into the runout of the Dside of <<Pulse Demon>>) is complimenting or manifesting the spatiality of the trompe l'oeil coverart (the flat depth of the navmesh in bright green & red is an autostereogram encoding a massive apartmentblock at 8-Ya Liniya V.o., 31, 199178) is combining into the thing whose realization is well beyond my conceptual abilities without sitting down and just making it (as Grant Maierhofer is articlating in his text whose booktitle I am incapable of recalling -- Understanding Difficult Texts Or Artworks is Potentially Difficult For Their Creators As Well -- , my consideration or my reflection in this event back upon my own cognitive methodology is that it is a text without even resorting to analogical conceits it is a bookobject indistinguishable from the physicality of <<Blood Meridian>> or <<Gospoda Golovlyovy>>) this is a bookobject that is most effective asplay on a tabletop whose wood grain is active with similar figurations as the text (a textblock of textblocks (a modification of the Bodoni typeface) textwrapping & nesting in crossgrain disruptions is facilitating a reading methodology identical (in a striking departure from the expectations of conventional reading methodologies) to that of my cognition lying here beneath Marina's bed)), although she is administratively viable she nonexistent in the way that a human is parlaying food & oxygen into consciousness and without physical life it is a certainty that Marina is perfecting escaping into the stillness of this event just as I am although amidst far more trauma than even the stillness of my death is crushing my cells with the burdenment of stagnant blood (an anatomical characteristic of hers that is inseparable from what knowledge we have of her poetry or her even more exceptional prose writings), I'm asking her -- are We Going For Supper -- despite knowing she is destitute and not requiring sustenance for sustaining her physical presence as the indehiscent husk of her material being, her solidity is black, involution & invagination, from well across the ADAmone her blackness is radiating is gathering gravity from greater stretchings of the topography drowning me in the guiltiness of lovingly touching nothingness, in her escaping I am curious where she's the capability of going, being only physical and nothing else is she becoming purely consciousness, affecting numbness in the extremities is allowing the illusion of external stimuli, all physical touching is through the mediation of the platter, the alluring combinations of aroma & tonguetaste permeating the tryst are understandable through the correlation of a variety of administrative protocols, lying together on the (Marina is on the pallet & I am curling as closely as I can to her on the wood flooring) -- is It Not Odd We are Dismissive Of The Vision Of Cats As

linguistic descriptions of anything (whether writing it out or composing it in the consciousness) are dependent on analogical constructions, thus the quality of touching Marina or more precisely the impossibility of touching a living ghost (not that her physicality is differing from any other human but she has the recognition that we and all are primarily voidspace between particles passing through one another and although I am touching her she is not receiving my touching) even as she is stimulating my nerve endings to orgasm, I've an understanding of the data of our union and its administrative functionality but not of its physicality, it is not that it is illusory but that it is inert & clinical -- Nobody is Watching Your Departure With More Irrevocable Gentleness
