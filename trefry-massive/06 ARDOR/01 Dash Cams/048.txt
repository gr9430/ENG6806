a man in a black tracksuit is teetering to his feet up from the asphalt--blankly absent of meshtracks is an emptiness indicative of the voronoi--is in value of blackishness merging with the central of three doublecircuit trusstowers diagonals is stumbling away from a windshield lying on the dull asphalt is limpidly reflecting the sky, a small dumptruck is turning right from the through street of the T intersection is sweeping its white headlights through the uniform luminance of the overcast vista and out of the vista ahead of a small black offroad auto turning left, trees bristly and foamy in their filtering of the cloudless sky far in the distance at the horizon are dead and colorless, yield, an equilateral triangle with one edge horizontal and the third vertex pointing down, dull black structural members of the waveringly turning doublecircuit trusstowers are crossing and driftingly merging with the restless perspective nodding is causing the inability of establishing which members are in the foreground and which in the background are gently interlacing on each trusstower is of slightly different composition and proportion--on the basis of where their prefabrication segmentations are occuring--with all varieties of triangle, even in the combinative presence of irregular quadrilaterals & other ngons with knowledge that performance of a truss is optimally employing triangular translation of loading--the symmetrical nature of trusses is insuring the presence of isoceles, although verifying the presence of an equilateral triangle in the truss webs is impossible--a triangle is equilateral only to the geometer constructing it with a compass & straightedge--in the moire morass of foreshortening into ambiguous collections of polygons, the energy of the spinning black sedan is centrifugally forcing a man in a black tracksuit out of the flapping driverside door onto the asphalt--a fourcolor beadquilt of warm grays reintegrating the creeping formmaking of the cumulonimbus dewpoint--onto his shoulderblades rollingly in the opposite direction of the auto spinning upright into sitting and lifting himself to his feet amidst fragmentation of black plastic, distant gooseneck downlight arrayals atop poles each with a numerical signage cube at the midpoint height--those visible are 10 & 14 & 76--amidst a grid of milkglass ellipsoids atop the flaring bobèches of slender black posts, treefoam treesponge treemegascleres treespicule, nothing in the sky is not tree, janusface signage in equilateral triangular footprint arrangement is announcing the expansion of frontier dwelling massives <<contactperson „Steve Choikhit“>>, an equilateral triangle with an intuitively red border that in actuality is <<black magic>>--a charcoal valuation of a rich golden hue--and the apparent actual manifestation of redness is dull <<cab sav>> is emblematic of the general dullness of the overcast vista, a white or silver--or any hue tintingly lighter in value & thinly pale in saturation is indistinguishable from any other in the overall lack of hue, hatchback is speeding into the vista and is not stopping is ramming the rearwing of a black sedan is cutting across the through street of the T intersection spinning in reversal of its forward momentem that is throwing open its driverside door
