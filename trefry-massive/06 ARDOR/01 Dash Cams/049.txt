slapping black blades slashing bright whiteness is whitebalancing the stormy sky against the conflagration of fuscia is consuming the roadway beside a blue autofreighter hauling a large translucent cylindrical tank of opaque blue liquid is racing away from the unanticipatable phenomenon of stopmotion incendiary tesselation, the conflagration is expanding across the entire sky curling the tiling of its hues around veils of black smoky plumage, quickly devouring the oxygen of a tiny red pickup occupant's lungs exhaling into the oxygenation of the rushing highway gale is braiding the flames over mucose filmstock is stiflingly filling with sooty smokescreen, a black fleck is ballistically lofting linedrive along the opposite fogline out of the field of vision, the long dash on the roadway is sliding beneath and disappearing leaving the greater space before the next dash and the lines on the roadway are growing longer in their slowing haltingly the continuous fogline is a flaming streakage of white flame vaguely coronal with creamscicle, molecular diffusion is drawing oxygen to the conflagration and is lolling forth combustion products from the conflagration in coagulatory thickness and relatively hypnotic thick slowness over the guardrail balusters rhythmically slowing and stopping in the absence of the little red pickup are only fire & smoke & empty roadway and oncoming headlights lensflaring the apparition of a mustardy oblique roadsign, an internal combustion or a crumb of asphalt nicking up from the roadway igniting gyrobifastigia of septane engulfingly in flame tesserae with screwsymmetry honeycombing elongations of the digonal gyrobicupola selftesselating the palette of cold reds and yellows drawing down the latent blue of the sky and expelling the warmth of crystalline firehue plesiohedral outward across the panorama, cubic droplets of flame tiling in stillframe tendrils, in the thinness of dissipating smokiness dash space particulate combustion production is turning mossgreen, in the precision flashing of ignition a black silhouette--the head of a black hound & a black triangle with radius vertices and one concave leg & a portion of unfolding an ornate black stationery envelope--is within the framespace of fire and disappearing in its consumption rushing expansively across the vista,
