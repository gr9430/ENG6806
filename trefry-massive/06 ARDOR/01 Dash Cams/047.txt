snowpack inscribingly highlighting the black limbs of planetree mutilation is leaving the smudgy amputee artifacts of pollarding against the bleak sunless sky bluegray of a three storey massive with windows illuminated all across its second storey--green pustules of muntin devouring profusion--and the polymer stucco quoins bloodlessly gray and shadowless above a solid black silhouette is walking behind the snowbank on the curb, spore smoak lofting into undetectable diffusion from the pouty nubs of the planetree limbs, the slender turbine factory windows reflecting the featureless sky openness blankly receiving a man in black trousers and a tennis shirt is running across three lanes of autotraffic folding his body into the glaring liquidity of headlights is leaping into the air, porcelain insulators silhouettingly crackling and skipping into occlusionary solidity on the wire network of a transport overhead contactsystem and stopping above a man rising to his knees on the asphalt in front of the transport stopping beside the snowbank and turning off its headlights, the plastic frontbumper of the transport is cantileveringly lolling against the feet of a man lying on the asphalt in exhaustion stainy and glowing auto headlights approaching in the exsufflation of condensing autoexhaust collecting in spectral peeling pantingly fairyflossing across the windshield scope refinement for idly cataloging each foliate exudation of rheumy whitehot luminance across the streetscape framy by framy, bright cabin lamps blooming across the ceiling of an outgoing transport in overlapping and proliferating reflective multiplication on the smoky tinting of the ribbon window is falling behind the vista a parabola of luminance spiking across the back of a man walking across the street is sprinting through a ribbon of light across black trousers across the back of his thighs and accelerating into a streaking of light across its glossy white sidepanel is reflecting from the back of a green sedan is advancing in front of a man walking across the road and sprinting into the lane of oncoming vehicles autoexhaust is twisting dispersingly through the headlights of an oncoming sedan is unifying the sedan bonnet to the long glaring conic section across the fender of the transport and the headlights graduatingly fading to precisely the hue and intensity of the entire sky measurable by an 80column encryption of stationary rainwater or condensation chads revealing the receptive emptiness that is underlying all brightness against which all else is in motion where even nominal blackness is the desaturation of indigo with some quantity of luminance that through phagocytosis each converging constellation is becoming a singularly glowing palinopsia behind the man running toward an approaching transport, the precise figuration of a red autodelivery truck advancing up the roadway is suffusing into the red corona of brakelights, a man is leaping with his arms are spreading facefirst into the driverside windshield pane of the oncoming transport is lurching to halting frustration over the man tumbling back onto his shoulders and cracking his skull against the asphalt,
