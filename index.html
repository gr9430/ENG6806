<p><small><i>Cultural Studies Scholar, First-Year Composition Instructor, Copyeditor, and Creative Practitioner</i></small></p>
<p>
    My work as an interdisciplinary scholar-practitioner lies at the intersection of creative practice, critical making, and decolonial inquiry. Through this ePortfolio, I reflect on my experiences in ENG 6806: Humanities in the Age of AI, where I have explored generative AI, digital storytelling, and critical media analysis. Throughout this course, I have gained invaluable insights into my dual identity as an academic and creative, discovering how to blend these aspects seamlessly to create meaningful work.</p>
  <p>Engaging with generative AI has prompted me to rethink the boundaries between still and moving images, literature and digital media, and the possibilities of interactive storytelling. During this semester, I shared some of these insights with my ENC 1101 class, enriching their understanding of digital media's role in storytelling. By revisiting my past creative practices—including music, design, and experimental literature—I have deepened my understanding of how digital tools can challenge dominant narratives and amplify underrepresented voices.</p>
    <p>Moving forward, I intend to build on this foundation by developing projects that bridge creative expression and critical scholarship, ultimately fostering inclusive digital spaces. This course has reinforced my commitment to making digital humanities accessible and transformative, both for myself and for my students. My teaching practice emphasizes creativity, reflection, and accessibility, encouraging students to think critically about technology's role in cultural production. Through my work, I strive to create more inclusive and imaginative digital spaces that amplify marginalized voices.
