    <h1>The Waves Forget the Structure</h1>
    <p>
An adaptation of my failed "Games" experiment, I decided to make this a simple point and click experience that generates a poem for the user based on the sequence in which they click the items.
    </p>
<p>
  This is a simple generator, but exciting, as I was able to push my project "The Waves Forget the Shoreline" even further. Ironically, I completed this after my "Recapitating <i></i>Massive</i>" Markov model experiment.</p>
    <p>Working with these generators has probably become the most exciting part of this course for me, as it somehow feels more literary and analytical than I have felt in all my education thus far.
</p>
    <p>This project generated text through a conversation with ChatGPT, initially implementing ASCII style text to try and 'animate' the poem in consideration of Kamau Braithwaite's work. The text from that poem was then imported into Dall-E in an attempt to align the image output with my own artistic practice.</p>
